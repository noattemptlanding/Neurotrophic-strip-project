abstract = {Although the application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in stem cell–replacement therapy remains promising, its potential is hindered by a low cell survival rate in post-transplantation within the inner ear. Here, we aim to enhance the in vitro and in vivo survival rate and neuronal differentiation of otic neuronal progenitors (ONPs) by generating an artificial stem cell niche consisting of three-dimensional (3D) hESC-derived ONP spheroids with a nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel and a sustained-release brain-derivative neurotrophic factor delivery system. Our results demonstrated that the transplanted hESC-derived ONP spheroids survived and neuronally differentiated into otic neuronal lineages in vitro and in vivo and also extended neurites toward the bony wall of the cochlea 90 days after the transplantation without the use of immunosuppressant medication. Our data in vitro and in vivo presented here provide sufficient evidence that we have established a robust, reproducible protocol for in vivo transplantation of hESC-derived ONPs to the inner ear. Using our protocol to create an artificial stem cell niche in the inner ear, it is now possible to work on integrating transplanted hESC-derived ONPs further and also to work toward achieving functional auditory neurons generated from hESCs. Our findings suggest that the provision of an artificial stem cell niche can be a future approach to stem cell–replacement therapy for inner-ear regeneration.},

abstract = {Cortical interneurons,generated predominantly in the medial ganglionic eminence,migrate around and avoid the developing striatum in the subpallium en route to the cortex. This is attributable to the chemorepulsive cues of class 3 semaphorins expressed in the striatal mantle and acting through neuropilin (Nrp1 and Nrp2) receptors expressed in these cells. Cortical interneurons also express Robo receptors, and we show here that in mice lacking Robo1, but not Robo2, these cells migrate aberrantly through the striatum. In vitro experiments demonstrated that interneurons lacking Robo1 function are significantly less responsive to the effects of semaphorins. Failure to respond to semaphoring appears to be attributabl to a reduction in Nrp1 and PlexinA1receptors within these cells. Biochemical studies further demonstrated that Robo1 binds directly to Nrp1, but not to semaphorins, and this interaction is mediated by a region contained within its first two Ig domains. Thus, we show for the first time that Robo1 interacts with Nrp1 to modulate semaphorin signaling in the developing forebrain and direct the migration of interneurons through the subpallium and into the cortex. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

abstract = {The study of the structure and function of neuronal cells and networks is of crucial importance in the endeavor to understand how the brain works. A key component in this process is the extraction of neuronal morphology from microscopic imaging data. In the past four decades, many computational methods and tools have been developed for digital reconstruction of neurons from images, with limited success. As witnessed by the growing body of literature on the subject, as well as the organization of challenging competitions in the field, the quest for a robust and fully automated system of more general applicability still continues. The aim of this work, is to contribute by surveying recent developments in the field for anyone interested in taking up the challenge.

abstract = {The application of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a promising pharmacological approach in cochlear implant research. Several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that treatment with neurotrophins support the spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) survival and the synapses. Of the more than 40 companies that are working in the field of inner ear therapeutics, only one company is currently advancing BDNF towards clinical translation. Thus, there are no approved clinical therapies with neurotrophins, their precursors or neurotrophin-like substances. For a better understanding of the mechanisms of BDNF in the inner ear, we analysed the expression of mature BDNF (mBDNF), its pro-form proBDNF and their respective receptors the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (NTRK2). In the adult murine inner ear, mBDNF is expressed in the inner and outer hair cells (IHC and OHC) of the organ of Corti and in the spiral ganglion of the Rosenthal's canal, whereas proBDNF is only detected in the supporting cells below the OHC. The corresponding receptors NTRK2 and p75NTR are expressed in the spiral ganglion whereof p75NTR is stronger expressed. For more insights in the effects of mBDNF and proBDNF on inner ear specific cells, we treated primary dissociated SGN with different concentrations of mBDNF and proBDNF alone and in combination. Interestingly, treatment with proBDNF is not toxic for SGN but simultaneously not protective. However, combined treatment of mBDNF and proBDNF maintained and perhaps slightly increased the protective effect of mBDNF. Thus, the mixture of mBDNF and proBDNF could be the new direction for the development of BDNF-based therapeutics in cochlear implantation and could represent more precisely the natural environment.},

abstract = {Most cortical interneurons arise from the subcortical telencephalon, but the molecules that control their migration remain largely unidentified. Here, we show that different isoforms of Neuregulin-1 are expressed in the developing cortex and in the route that migrating interneurons follow toward the cortex, whereas a population of the migrating interneurons express ErbB4, a receptor for Neuregulin-1. The different isoforms of Neuregulin-1 act as short- and long-range attractants for migrating interneurons, and perturbing ErbB4 function in vitro decreases the number of interneurons that tangentially migrate to the cortex. In vivo, loss of Neuregulin-1/ErbB4 signaling causes an alteration in the tangential migration of cortical interneurons and a reduction in the number of GABAergic interneurons in the postnatal cortex. These observations provide evidence that Neuregulin-1 and its ErbB4 receptor directly control neuronal migration in the nervous system.},

Angular distributions of fibers in composites define their material properties. In biological tissues, cell and fiber orientation distributions are important since they define their mechanical properties and function. We developed a filtering scheme for the DFT to predict angular distributions accurately. The errors involved in this DFT technique and their sources were quantified through Monte Carlo simulation of computer-generated images. The knowledge of these errors allows one to verify the suitability of the method for a particular application. We found that the DFT method is most accurate for slender fibers, and propose a means to minimize errors by optimizing parameters. This method was applied to predict orientation distribution of cells and actin fibers in bio-artificial tissue constructs. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Neurotrophic factors are important for the development and maintenance of the auditory system. They have also been shown to act as survival factors for auditory neurons in animal deafness models. Studies have demonstrated recently that these neurotrophic factors not only maintain survival of auditory neurons, but that these surviving neurons retain functionality. It remains to be determined, however, if a single administration of a neurotrophic factor is sufficient to maintain auditory neuron survival after loss of hair cells, or if sustained delivery is required. This study investigated the longevity of the survival effects of BDNF on auditory neurons in deafened guinea pigs. Briefly, the left cochleae of deafened guinea pigs were infused with BDNF for 28 days via a mini-osmotic pump, and neuronal survival was analyzed at various stages after the completion of treatment. BDNF treatment prevented the degeneration of auditory neurons that normally is seen after a loss of hair cells, supporting previous studies. Our results indicate, however, that cessation of BDNF treatment leads to an accelerated decline in auditory neuron survival as compared to that observed in deafened, untreated cochleae. These findings indicate that much work remains to be done to establish a technique for the long-term survival of auditory neurons in the deaf ear.},

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in cognitive processes including learning and memory. However, it has been difficult to detect BDNF in the brains of behaving animals because of its extremely low concentration, i.e., at the sub-nanogram/mL level. Here, we developed an interdigitated microelectrode (IME) biosensor coated with an anti-BDNF an anti-BDNF antibody in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic channel chip. This sensor could detect BDNF from microliter volumes of liquid samples even at femtogram/mL concentrations with high selectivity over other growth factors. Using this biosensor, we examined whether BDNF is detectable from periodical collection of cerebrospinal fluid microdialysate, sampled every 10 min from the hippocampus of mice during the context-dependent fear-conditioning test. We found that the IME biosensor could detect a significant increase in BDNF levels after the memory task. This increase in BDNF levels was prevented by gene silencing of BDNF, indicating that the IME biosensor reliably detected BDNF in vivo. We propose that the IME biosensor provides a general-purpose probe for ultrasensitive detection of biomolecules with low abundance in the brains of behaving animals.},

abstract = {The differentiation of fibroblasts to contractile myofibroblasts, which is characterized by de novo expression of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA), is crucial for wound healing and a hallmark of tissue scarring and fibrosis. These processes often follow inflammatory events, particularly in soft tissues such as skin, lung and liver. Although inflammatory cells and damaged epithelium can release transforming growth factor $\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1), which largely mediates myofibroblast differentiation, the biophysical environment of inflammation and tissue regeneration, namely increased interstitial flow owing to vessel hyperpermeability and/or angiogenesis, may also play a role. We demonstrate that low levels of interstitial (3D) flow induce fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation as well as collagen alignment and fibroblast proliferation, all in the absence of exogenous mediators. These effects were associated with TGF-$\beta$1 induction, and could be eliminated with TGF-$\beta$1 blocking antibodies. Furthermore, $\alpha$1$\beta$1, integrin was seen to play an important role in the specific response to flow, as its inhibition prevented fibroblast differentiation and subsequent collagen alignment but did not block their ability to contract the gel in a separate floating gel assay. This study suggests that the biophysical environment that often precedes fibrosis, such as swelling, increased microvascular permeability and increased lymphatic drainage - all which involve interstitial fluid flow - may itself play an important role in fibrogenesis.},

abstract = {Neurotrophic factor delivery to sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) promotes axon growth into but not beyond lesion sites. We tested the hypothesis that sustained growth factor gradients beyond regions of SCI will promote significant axonal bridging into and beyond lesions. Adult rats underwent C3 lesions to transect ascending dorsal column sensory axons, and autologous bone marrow stromal cells were grafted into the lesion to provide a cellular bridge for growth into the injured region. Concurrently, lentiviral vectors expressing neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) (controls) were injected into the host cord rostral to the lesion to promote axon extension beyond the graft/lesion. Four weeks later, NT-3 gradients beyond the lesion were detectable by ELISA in animals that received NT-3-expressing lentiviral vectors, with highest average NT-3 levels located near the rostral vector injection site. Significantly more ascending sensory axons extended into tissue rostral to the lesion site in animals injected with NT-3 vectors compared with GFP vectors, but only if the zone of NT-3 vector transduction extended continuously from the injection site to the graft; any "gap" in NT-3 expression from the graft to rostral tissue resulted in axon bridging failure. Despite axon bridging beyond the lesion, regenerating axons did not continue to grow over very long distances, even in the presence of a continuing growth factor gradient beyond the lesion. These findings indicate that a localized and continuous gradient of NT-3 can achieve axonal bridging beyond the glial scar, but growth for longer distances is not sustainable simply with a trophic stimulus.

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

The physical trauma of implantation and subsequent immunological sequelae can affect residual hearing and the viability of the spiral ganglion. An ideal electrode should therefore decrease post-implantation trauma and provide support to the residual spiral ganglion population. Combining a flexible electrode with cells producing and releasing protective factors could present a potential means to achieve this. Mononuclear cells obtained from bone marrow (BM-MNC) consist of mesenchymal and hematopoietic progenitor cells. They possess the innate capacity to induce repair of traumatized tissue and to modulate immunological reactions. Methods: Human bone marrow was obtained from the patients that received treatment with biohybrid electrodes. Autologous mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow (BM-MNC) by centrifugation using the Regenlab™ THT-centrifugation tubes. Isolated BM-MNC were characterised using flow cytometry. In addition, the release of cytokines was analysed and their biological effect tested on spiral ganglion neurons isolated from neonatal rats. Fibrin adhesive (Tisseal™) was used for the coating of silicone-based cochlear implant electrode arrays for human use in order to generate biohybrid electrodes. Toxicity of the fibrin adhesive and influence on insertion, as well on the cell coating, was investigated. Furthermore, biohybrid electrodes were implanted in three patients. Results: Human BM-MNC release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Using fibrin adhesive as a carrier for BM-MNC, a simple and effective cell coating procedure for cochlear implant electrodes was developed that can be utilised on-site in the operating room for the generation of biohybrid electrodes for intracochlear cell-based drug delivery. A safety study demonstrated the feasibility of autologous progenitor cell transplantation in humans as an adjuvant to cochlear implantation for neurosensory restoration. Conclusion: This is the first report of the use of autologous cell transplantation to the human inner ear. Due to the simplicity of this procedure, we hope to initiate its widespread utilization in various fields.},

abstract = {Histological studies have shown that the Melbourne/Cochlear electrode array lies along the outer wall of the scala tympani and is therefore some distance from the residual VIIIth nerve elements. In order to investigate the influence of electrode position on neural excitation we systematically varied the position of the electrode array within the cat scala tympani while recording electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (EABRs). Using both normal hearing and long-term deafened animals, we observed significant reductions in EABR thresholds as the electrode array was moved from the outer wall towards the modiolus. Further threshold reductions were observed when the array was placed underneath the osseous spiral lamina (OSL) close to the peripheral dendrites. These changes were independent of the bipolar inter-electrode separation, and were observed over a wide range of cochlear pathologies varying from normal to a moderate spiral ganglion cell loss. Interestingly, the one animal exhibiting extensive neural loss showed no correlation between EABR threshold and electrode position. There was also a general decrease in the gradient of the EABR input-output function as the electrode array was moved closer to the neural elements. This was, however, only statistically significant when the electrode was positioned adjacent to the peripheral dendrites. Significant reductions in EABR threshold were also observed as the inter-electrode spacing of the bipolar electrodes was increased. The gradient of the EABR input-output function also increased with increasing inter-electrode spacing, although again, this was only significant when the electrode array was positioned close to the neural elements. The present results indicate that the optimum placement of a Melbourne/Cochlear electrode array is adjacent to the peripheral dendrites. However, such a site would be difficult to achieve in practice while minimizing insertion trauma. An array lying adjacent to the modiolus would be a safe alternative while ensuring a significant reduction in threshold compared with the existing site (outer wall). This placement should result in more localized neural excitation patterns, an increase in the number of bipolar electrodes available, together with an increase in their dynamic range. These changes may lead to further improvements in speech perception among cochlear implant patients. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Growth factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are polypeptides that are involved in the maintenance, survival, and death of central and peripheral cells. Numerous growth factors have been identified in saliva and are thought to promote wound healing and maintenance of the oral epithelium. The aim of this study was to determine if BDNF is also found in human saliva. METHODS: Whole, unstimulated saliva samples (n = 30) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an anti-human BDNF antibody. Proteolytic cleavage products were similarly assessed following the incubation of pooled saliva with N-glycanase F and plasmin. Subjects were also genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). RESULTS: These experiments revealed the presence of immunoreactive bands at 14, 32 and 34 kDa, corresponding to mature (mBDNF) and proBDNF, as well as a truncated pro-form at 24 kDa. Not every sample contained all forms of BDNF. Treatment with N-glycanase and plasmin reduced the size of the higher molecular weight bands, confirming the glycosylated pro-form of BDNF. mBDNF was detected significantly less often in subjects with the Val66Met SNP, compared to those without the polymorphism (chi(2) = 4.05; P {\{}$\backslash$textless{\}} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: While the function of salivary BDNF still requires elucidation, these findings suggest that it may be possible to use saliva in lieu of blood in future studies of BDNF and the Val66Met polymorphism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in neurite  outgrowth and differentiation, accurate and reproducible segmentation and quantification of neuronal processes are a prerequisite. To facilitate this task, we developed a semiautomatic neurite tracing technique. This article describes the design and validation of the technique. METHODS: The technique was compared to fully manual delineation. Four observers repeatedly traced selected neurites in 20 fluorescence microscopy images of cells in culture, using both methods. Accuracy and reproducibility were determined by comparing the tracings to high-resolution reference tracings, using two error measures. Labor intensiveness was measured in numbers of mouse clicks required. The significance of the results was determined by a Student t-test and by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Both methods slightly underestimated the true neurite length, but the differences were not unanimously significant. The average deviation from the true neurite centerline was a factor 2.6 smaller with the developed technique compared to fully manual tracing. Intraobserver variability in the respective measures was reduced by a factor 6.0 and 23.2. Interobserver variability was reduced by a factor 2.4 and 8.8, respectively, and labor intensiveness by a factor 3.3. CONCLUSIONS: Providing similar accuracy in measuring neurite length, significantly improved accuracy in neurite centerline extraction, and significantly improved reproducibility and reduced labor intensiveness, the developed technique may replace fully manual tracing methods.},

abstract = {Cochlear implants (CI) restore functional hearing in the majority of deaf patients. Despite the tremendous success of these devices, some limitations remain. The bottleneck for optimal electrical stimulation with CI is caused by the anatomical gap between the electrode array and the auditory neurons in the inner ear. As a consequence, current devices are limited through 1) low frequency resolution, hence sub-optimal sound quality and 2), large stimulation currents, hence high energy consumption (responsible for significant battery costs and for impeding the development of fully implantable systems). A recently completed, multinational and interdisciplinary project called NANOCI aimed at overcoming current limitations by creating a gapless interface between auditory nerve fibers and the cochlear implant electrode array. This ambitious goal was achieved in vivo by neurotrophin-induced attraction of neurites through an intracochlear gel-nanomatrix onto a modified nanoCI electrode array located in the scala tympani of deafened Guinea pigs. Functionally, the gapless interface led to lower stimulation thresholds and a larger dynamic range in vivo, and to reduced stimulation energy requirement (up to fivefold) in an in vitro model using auditory neurons cultured on multi-electrode arrays. In conclusion, the NANOCI project yielded proof of concept that a gapless interface between auditory neurons and cochlear implant electrode arrays is feasible. These findings may be of relevance for the development of future CI systems with better sound quality and performance and lower energy consumption. The present overview/review paper summarizes the NANOCI project history and highlights achievements of the individual work packages.},

abstract = {The spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the afferent neurons of the cochlea, connecting the auditory sensory cells-hair cells-to the brainstem cochlear nuclei. The neurotrophins neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are expressed in the cochlea and both support SGN survival during development. These neurotrophins remain expressed in the postnatal cochlea and continue to play additional roles for SGNs, contributing to maintenance of hair cell-SGN synapses and regulating expression of ion channels, presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, and SGN membrane electrical properties in a physiologically important spatial pattern. Remarkably, NT-3 and BDNF have different, even opposing, effects on SGN physiology despite the close similarity of their receptors TrkB and TrkC. Recent studies have also raised the possibility that precursor proneurotrophin forms of the neurotrophins play a role in responses to trauma in the cochlea, signaling through the proneurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) . Here, we review expression and function of neurotrophins and their p75(NTR) and Trk-family receptors in the cochlea. We focus, in particular, on neurotrophin functions other than support of SGN survival, including regulation of SGN neurite growth, synaptic and membrane physiology. These functions, unlike survival, are ones for which BDNF and NT-3 substantially differ in their effects. Signal transduction mechanisms of p75(NTR) and of Trk-family receptors are discussed, indicating how these lead to different responses, and we speculate on how BDNF and NT-3 can cause different phenotypic changes in SGNs. Because these complex signaling interactions remain incompletely understood, use of neurotrophins as therapeutic agents in the cochlea should be approached with caution.

Here, we describe the first genetic study of EB1 in developing animals. We show that one of the multiple Drosophila EB1 homologues, DmEB1, is ubiquitously expressed and has essential functions during development. Hypomorphic DmEB1 mutants show neuromuscular defects, including flightlessness and uncoordinated movement, without any general cell division defects. These defects can be partly explained by the malfunction of the chordotonal mechanosensory organs. In fact, electrophysiological measurements indicated that the auditory chordotonal organs show a reduced response to sound stimuli. The internal organization of the chordotonal organs also is affected in the mutant. Consistently, DmEB1 is enriched in those regions important for the structure and function of the organs. Therefore, DmEB1 plays a crucial role in the functional and structural integrity of the chordotonal mechanosensory organs in Drosophila.},

The extremely stable polyhedra matrix may provide a platform for future engineered micro-crystal devices. However, the protein composition of the polyhedra matrix remains largely unknown. In this study, the occlusion-derived virus (ODV)-removed BmNPV polyhedra matrix fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then an LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis using a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer. In total, 28 host and 91 viral proteins were identified. The host components were grouped into one of six categories, i.e., chaperones, ubiquitin and related proteins, host helicases, cytoskeleton-related proteins, RNA-binding proteins and others, according to their predicted Pfam domain(s). Most viral proteins may not be essential for polyhedra assembly, as evidenced by studies in the literature showing that polyhedra formation occurs in the nucleus upon the disruption of individual genes. The structural role of these proteins in baculovirus replication will be of significant interest in future studies. The immobilization of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) into the polyhedra by fusing with the C-terminus of BM134 that is encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 134 suggested that the polyhedra had a powerful capacity to trap foreign proteins, and BM134 was a potential carrier for incorporating proteins of interest into the polyhedra.},

Our approach is to transform the scale of a generating distribution, such as the von Mises, using various nontrivial extensions of an approach first used in Batschelet's (1981,Circular Statistics in Biology) book. The key is to employ inverses of Batschelet-type transformations in certain ways; these exhibit considerable advantages over direct Batschelet transformations. The skewness transformation is especially appealing as it has no effect on the normalizing constant. As well as a variety of interesting theoretical properties, when likelihood inference is explored these distributions display orthogonality between elements of a pairing of parameters into (location, skewness) and (concentration, peakedness). Further, the location parameter can sometimes be made approximately orthogonal to all the other parameters. Profile likelihoods come to the fore in practice.

In this study, the efficacy of delivering exogenous BDNF to the left hippocampus is demonstrated in wild-type mice (n = 7) through the noninvasively disrupted bloodbrain barrier (BBB) using focused ultrasound (FUS). The BDNF bioactivity was found to be preserved following delivery as assessed quantitatively by immunohistochemical detection of the pTrkB receptor and activated pAkt, pMAPK, and pCREB in the hippocampal neurons. It was therefore shown for the first time that systemically administered neurotrophic factors can cross the noninvasively disrupted BBB and trigger neuronal downstream signaling effects in a highly localized region in the brain. This is the first time that the administered molecule is tracked through the BBB and localized in the neuron triggering molecular effects. Additional preliminary findings are shown in wild-type mice with two additional neurotrophic factors such as the glia-derived neurotrophic factor (n = 12) and neurturin (n = 2). This further demonstrates the impact of FUS for the early treatment of CNS diseases at the cellular and molecular level and strengthens its premise for FUS-assisted drug delivery and efficacy. {\textcopyright}2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

abstract = {In vitro assays to measure neuronal growth are a fundamental tool used by many neurobiologists studying neuronal development and regeneration. The quantification of these assays requires accurate measurements of neurite length and neuronal cell numbers in neuronal cultures. Generally, these measurements are obtained through labor-intensive manual or semi-manual tracing of images. To automate these measurements, we have written NeuriteTracer, a neurite tracing plugin for the freely available image-processing program ImageJ. The plugin analyzes fluorescence microscopy images of neurites and nuclei of dissociated cultured neurons. Given user-defined thresholds, the plugin counts neuronal nuclei, and traces and measures neurite length. We find that NeuriteTracer accurately measures neurite outgrowth from cerebellar, DRG and hippocampal neurons. Values obtained by NeuriteTracer correlate strongly with those obtained by semi-manual tracing with NeuronJ and by using a sophisticated analysis package, MetaXpress. We reveal the utility of NeuriteTracer by demonstrating its ability to detect the neurite outgrowth promoting capacity of the rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Our plugin is an attractive alternative to existing tracing tools because it is fully automated and ready for use within a freely accessible imaging program. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), which are wholly synthetic materials with antibody-like ability to bind and discriminate between molecules, demonstrate improved stability and reduced fabrication cost as compared with biological receptors. Here we report, for the first time, a MIP-based synthetic receptor capable of selective binding of a clinically relevant protein – the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The BDNF-MIP was generated by surface-initiated controlled/living radical photopolymerization directly on a screen-printed electrode (SPE). The resulting BDNF-MIP/SPE electrochemical sensor could detect BDNF down to 6 pg/mL in the presence of the interfering HSA protein and was capable of discriminating BDNF among its structural analogues, i.e. neurotropic factors CDNF and MANF. We believe that the presented approach for the preparation of a neurotrophic factor-selective sensor could be a promising route towards the development of innovative PoC diagnostics devices for the early-stage diagnostics and/or monitoring the therapy of neurological diseases.},

Most of the approaches currently under development involve transplantation of immature progenitors that subsequently undergo phenotypic and functional maturation in vivo, and predicting the long-term graft outcome already at the progenitor stage remains a challenge. Here, we took an unbiased approach to identify predictive markers expressed in dopamine neuron progenitors that correlate with graft outcome in an animal model of Parkinson's disease through gene expression analysis of {\textgreater}30 batches of grafted human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived progenitors. We found that many of the commonly used markers did not accurately predict in vivo subtype-specific maturation. Instead, we identified a specific set of markers associated with the caudal midbrain that correlate with high dopaminergic yield after transplantation in vivo. Using these markers, we developed a good manufacturing practice (GMP) differentiation protocol for highly efficient and reproducible production of transplantable dopamine progenitors from hESCs.},

The resulting otic progenitor cells were subjected to varying differentiation conditions, one of which promoted the organization of the cells into epithelial clusters displaying hair cell-like cells with stereociliary bundles.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The success of cochlear implantation may be further improved by minimizing implantation trauma. The physical trauma of implantation and subsequent immunological sequelae can affect residual hearing and the viability of the spiral ganglion. An ideal electrode should therefore decrease post-implantation trauma and provide support to the residual spiral ganglion population. Combining a flexible electrode with cells producing and releasing protective factors could present a potential means to achieve this. Mononuclear cells obtained from bone marrow (BM-MNC) consist of mesenchymal and hematopoietic progenitor cells. They possess the innate capacity to induce repair of traumatized tissue and to modulate immunological reactions. METHODS: Human bone marrow was obtained from the patients that received treatment with biohybrid electrodes. Autologous mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow (BM-MNC) by centrifugation using the Regenlab™ THT-centrifugation tubes. Isolated BM-MNC were characterised using flow cytometry. In addition, the release of cytokines was analysed and their biological effect tested on spiral ganglion neurons isolated from neonatal rats. Fibrin adhesive (Tisseal™) was used for the coating of silicone-based cochlear implant electrode arrays for human use in order to generate biohybrid electrodes. Toxicity of the fibrin adhesive and influence on insertion, as well on the cell coating, was investigated. Furthermore, biohybrid electrodes were implanted in three patients. RESULTS: Human BM-MNC release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Using fibrin adhesive as a carrier for BM-MNC, a simple and effective cell coating procedure for cochlear implant electrodes was developed that can be utilised on-site in the operating room for the generation of biohybrid electrodes for intracochlear cell-based drug delivery. A safety study demonstrated the feasibility of autologous progenitor cell transplantation in humans as an adjuvant to cochlear implantation for neurosensory restoration. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the use of autologous cell transplantation to the human inner ear. Due to the simplicity of this procedure, we hope to initiate its widespread utilization in various fields.},

abstract = {The VIII nerve is formed by sensory neurons that innervate the inner ear, i.e., the  vestibular and the auditory receptors. Neurons of the auditory portion, the cochlear afferent fibers that innervate the sensory hair cells of the organ of Corti, have their somas in the cochlear spiral ganglion where two types of neurons can be distinguished. Afferent Type-I neurons are the 95{\%} of the total population. Bipolar and myelinated fibers, each one innervates only one cochlear inner hair cell (IHC). In contrast, afferent Type-II neurons are only the 5{\%} of the spiral ganglion population. They are pseudounipolar and unmyelinated fibers and innervate the cochlear outer hair cells (OHC) so that one afferent Type-II fiber contacts with multiple OHCs, but each OHC only receives one contact from one Type-II neuron. Both types of VIII nerve fibers are glutamatergic, but these asymmetric innervations of the cochlear sensory cells could suggest that the IHC codifies the truly auditory message but the OHC only informs about mechanical aspects of the state of the organ of Corti. In fact, the central nervous system (CNS) has control over the information transmitted by the Type-I neuron by means of axons from the superior olivary complex that innervate them to modulate, filter and/or inhibit the entry of auditory message to CNS. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge about the anatomy and physiology of the auditory portion of the VIII nerve.

This paper establishes the feasibility of a reusable biosensor that can be operated and stored at room temperature, for detection of small molecules in low resource settings. The sensor was fabricated using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) and cortisol was chosen as a model analyte. Cortisol imprinted polymer films were prepared by electropolymerizing pyrrole on an electrode surface in the presence of cortisol. Electrochemical over-oxidation of polypyrrole (PPy) was performed for the controlled release of cortisol templates and to create cortisol specific imprinting sites. Stepwise fabrication of imprinted sensors was characterized through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The sensor exhibited a detection limit of 1 pM L− 1 for cortisol. A unique feature of the sensor was that cross-reactivity with prednisolone (which has 100{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} interference in ELISA), was minimized to 18.3{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} compared to ELISA. The sensitivity of the sensor remained over 90{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} after 7 cycles of elution/rebinding, while the sensitivity decreased by 10{\{}$\backslash${\%}{\}} after 4 weeks of storage at room temperature, suggesting the sensor can be used multiple times and used with low overhead costs in low resource settings such as agricultural fields. The sensor was used for detection of cortisol in saliva samples of farm workers; benchmarking with ELISA showed excellent correlation. These findings indicate that such a sensor can be used for in-field measurements of small molecules (e.g. cortisol).},

abstract = {Cancer is the result of the deregulation of cell proliferation and cell migration. In advanced tumors, cells invade the surrounding tissue and eventually form metastases. This is particularly evident in carcinomas in which epithelial cells have undergone epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Increased cell migration often correlates with a weakening of intercellular interactions. Junctions between neighboring epithelial cells are required to establish and maintain baso-apical polarity, suggesting that not only loss of cell–cell adhesion but also alteration of cell polarity is involved during invasion. Accordingly, perturbation of cell polarity is an important hallmark of advanced invasive tumors. Cell polarity is also essential for cell migration. Indeed, a front-rear polarity axis has first to be generated to allow a cell to migrate. Because cells migrate during invasion, cell polarity is not completely lost. Instead, polarity is modified. From a nonmigrating baso-apically polarized epithelial phenotype, cells acquire a polarized migrating mesenchymal phenotype. The aim of this review is to highlight the molecular relationship between the control of cell polarity and the regulation of cell motility during oncogenesis.},

abstract = {Soybean lipid emulsions, of which nutritional efficiency has been clearly demonstrated for thirty years, are essential components in parenteral nutrition. their metabolic features, physiologic impact and adverse effects were progressively described in the past years. More recently, new lipid emulsions, composed of medium-chain triglycerides, structured lipids, olive oil or fish oil were brought out to optimism the efficiency and safety of parenteral nutrition, but their qualitative specifications remain a controversial subject. Medium-chain triglycerides have a shorter plasmatic half-life and their metabolic rate is increased when compared to long-cain triglycerides. Structured lipids have a slower hydrolysis than medium-chain triglycerides, but they tend to induce a better nitrogen balance, particularly in septic patients. Cholestasis has been described with soybean long-chain triglycerides, but only when high amounts are given during a long time. In some studies, the hepatic tolerance seems better with medium-chain triglycerides, except in patients with short bowel. The potential advantages of an olive-oil emulsion on the hepatic functions are not yet demonstrated. Gaz exchange disturbances are observed with soybean oil, particularly when high levels are infused at a rapid rate. This respiratory dysfunction is essentially related with an increased intra-pulmonary shunting. Medium-chain triglycerides have less respiratory side-effects because they interfere very little with the prostanoid metabolism compared to long-chain triglycerides. High amounts of the first generation fat emulsions depress the immunologic responses. These adverse effects seem to be related with the high concentrations of essential fatty acids, which inhibit the delta-6-desaturase so decreasing poly-unsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids synthesis. the reduction of linoleic acid levels in medium chain triglycerides, olive oil and structured lipids partially explains the potentially better immunologic tolerance of the parenteral fat emulsions containing these fatty acids. Fish oils, with their high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, have important immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Because of its high concentration of oleic acid, olive oil resists better to lipid peroxydation than the other fat emulsions rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids. In several fields, experimental research has determined the potential benefits of the second generation fat emulsions. Clinicians have now to confirm if these experimental results have an interest in the medical practice and especially if nutritional manipulations of the immunologic and inflammatory systems are possible in stressed patients.},

abstract = {Within the neural engineering field, next-generation implantable neuroelectronic interfaces are being developed using biologically-inspired and/or biologically-derived materials to improve upon the stability and functional lifetime of current interfaces. These technologies are based around biomaterials, bioactive molecules, living cells, or some combination of these to promote host neuronal survival, reduce the foreign body response, and/or improve chronic device-tissue integration. This article provides a general overview of the different strategies, milestones, and evolution of such bioactive neural interfaces including electrode material properties, biological coatings, and “decoration” with living cells. Another such biohybrid approach developed in our lab uses preformed implantable micro-tissue featuring long-projecting axonal tracts encased within carrier biomaterial micro-columns. These so-called "living electrodes" have been engineered with carefully tailored material, mechanical, and biological properties to enable natural, synaptic based modulation of specific host circuitry while ultimately being under computer control. This article provides an overview of these axon-based living electrodes, including design and fabrication, performance attributes, as well as findings to date characterizing in vitro and in vivo functionality.},

These range from single-cell based assays that typically focus on molecular mechanisms to organotypic assays that aim to recapitulate in vivo behavior. By utilizing a combination of models, researchers can balance the speed, convenience, and mechanistic resolution of simpler models with the biological relevance of more complex models.

abstract = {Neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) provide essential cues to navigate growing axon toward their targets. Concentration and concentration gradient of NGF are key parameters affecting the growth rate and direction of neurites and axons. However, the maximum distance for guided nerve growth under stimulation of a single concentration gradient is limited and is thus unfavorable in nerve regeneration. Since the sensitivity of PC12 cells to NGF signals is restorable even after brief removal of the factors, exposure to multiple concentration gradients of the factor can achieve longer distances and greater rates of guided growth. In this study, a mathematical model simulating nerve growth in a virtually constructed nerve conduit incorporating multiple NGF concentration gradients is established. Using a genetic algorithm, optimized initial profiles of NGF able to achieve 4.5 cm of guided growth with a significantly improved growth rate has been obtained. The model also predicts an inverse relationship between the diffusion coefficient of the factor and the neurite growth rate. This model provides a useful tool for evaluating various conduit designs before fabrication and evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {The developing axon is believed to navigate towards its target tissue in response to a concentration gradient of neurotrophic factors, among other diffusible and surface-bound stimuli. However, the minimum concentration gradient required for guidance over the maximum distance is still unknown, largely because well-defined systems have not been utilized to address this question. In this study, a linear concentration gradient of nerve growth factor was achieved across a 5-mm agarose membrane that separated a nerve growth factor source compartment from a sink compartment. The concentrations in both compartments were maintained constant (and different). Both concentration and concentration gradient were well defined across the membrane, allowing us to study the relative importance of concentration gradient vs concentration for neurite guidance. The orientation of PC12 cell neurites was studied in response to a series of nerve growth factor concentration gradients in vitro. For effective guidance of PC12 cell neurite outgrowth, a minimum concentration gradient of 133 ng/ml per mm was required, below which guidance was ineffective. Higher gradients were effective for guidance yet were limited by the concentration of nerve growth factor in the source compartment. At a nerve growth factor concentration of 995 ng/ml, the PC12 cells' receptors were saturated, thereby limiting the maximum effective distance for guidance to less than 7.5 mm in response to a diffusible nerve growth factor cue. This distance exceeds the 0.5-2 mm distance observed by others for effective neurite guidance. Using this model system, we propose that the minimum concentration gradient can be defined for other cells and growth factors. Ultimately, it is anticipated that such concentration gradients could be included in a device to promote regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2001 IBRO.},

abstract = {Background: In order to reduce in vivo animal experiments in peripheral nerve regeneration research, in vitro models are desirable. Common two dimensional (2D) co-culture models lack the complex interactions of three dimensional (3D) physiological structures. The aim of the study was to establish a neuronal 3D spheroidal sprouting assay for peripheral nerve regeneration. New methodSpheroids consisting of Schwann cells (SC, 500 cells/spheroid) and NG108-15 cells (NG, 50 cells/spheroid), a hybrid cell line, were formed in hanging drops and were embedded in a 3D collagen matrix. Spheroid sprout lengths were compared to those of the neurites of NG in a 2D co-culture with SC. Lengths were measured using phase contrast images taken every day over 10 days. Additionally we took fluorescence images to visualize the PKH26-labeled NG in both culture systems. ResultsInitially thin neurites grew out in both co-cultures, over time the sprouts' diameter in the 3D culture increased. The direct comparison of the sprout length revealed significantly longer neurites in the 3D co-culture from day 7 until day 10 (. p{\textless}. 0.001). Comparison with: existing methodsOther co-culture models either display processes in 2D or need complex matrices to create 3D structures. Our spheroidal model is easy to establish, highly flexible and nevertheless 3D. ConclusionsThe 3D-Schwann cell-neuron spheroid model shows that by simply transferring a 2D into a 3D co-culture with multiplication of cell-cell contacts, a significant increase of neurite length can be achieved. The model is a relatively simple method for the investigation of neurite development in vitro.},

abstract = {Nerve growth cones (GCs) are chemical sensors that convert graded extracellular cues into oriented axonal motion. To ensure a sensitive and robust response to directional signals in complex and dynamic chemical landscapes, GCs are presumably able to amplify and filter external information. How these processing tasks are performed remains however poorly known. Here, we probe the signal-processing capabilities of single GCs during $\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) directional sensing with a shear-free microfluidic assay that enables systematic measurements of the GC output response to variable input gradients. By measuring at the single molecule level the polarization of GABAA chemoreceptors at the GC membrane, as a function of the external GABA gradient, we find that GCs act as i), signal amplifiers over a narrow range of concentrations, and ii), low-pass temporal filters with a cutoff frequency independent of stimuli conditions. With computational modeling, we determine that these systems-level properties arise at a molecular level from the saturable occupancy response and the lateral dynamics of GABAA receptors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The aims of this paper are to (i) provide a brief history of cochlear implants; (ii) present a status report on the current state of implant engineering and the levels of speech understanding enabled by that engineering; (iii) describe limitations of current signal processing strategies; and (iv) suggest new directions for research. With current technology the "average" implant patient, when listening to predictable conversations in quiet, is able to communicate with relative ease. However, in an environment typical of a workplace the average patient has a great deal of difficulty. Patients who are "above average" in terms of speech understanding, can achieve 100{\%} correct scores on the most difficult tests of speech understanding in quiet but also have significant difficulty when signals are presented in noise. The major factors in these outcomes appear to be (i) a loss of low-frequency, fine structure information possibly due to the envelope extraction algorithms common to cochlear implant signal processing; (ii) a limitation in the number of effective channels of stimulation due to overlap in electric fields from electrodes; and (iii) central processing deficits, especially for patients with poor speech understanding. Two recent developments, bilateral implants and combined electric and acoustic stimulation, have promise to remediate some of the difficulties experienced by patients in noise and to reinstate low-frequency fine structure information. If other possibilities are realized, e.g., electrodes that emit drugs to inhibit cell death following trauma and to induce the growth of neurites toward electrodes, then the future is very bright indeed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Cochlear implants (CI) allow for hearing rehabilitation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss or deafness. Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between spiral ganglion neurons and the CI, causing current spread that limits spatially restricted stimulation and impairs frequency resolution. This may be substantially improved by guiding peripheral processes of spiral ganglion neurons towards and onto the CI electrode contacts. An injectable, peptide-based hydrogel was developed which may provide a permissive scaffold to facilitate neurite growth towards the CI. To test hydrogel capacity to attract spiral ganglion neurites, neurite outgrowth was quantified in an in vitro model using a custom-designed hydrogel scaffold and PuraMatrix??. Neurite attachment to native hydrogels is poor, but significantly improved by incorporation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), covalent coupling of the bioactive laminin epitope IKVAV and the incorporation a full length laminin to hydrogel scaffolds. Incorporation of full length laminin protein into a novel custom-designed biofunctionalized hydrogel (IKVAV-GGG-SIINFEKL) allows for neurite outgrowth into the hydrogel scaffold. The study demonstrates that peptide-based hydrogels can be specifically biofunctionalized to provide a permissive scaffold to attract neurite outgrowth from spiral ganglion neurons.

The i.v. bolus injection technique was used in the cannulated brachial vein and artery using the same protein radioiodinated with a second isotope of iodine (125I vs.131I) to separately determine the PS and V(p) values.

The V(p) for NGF at the BNB was 1.92 ± 0.12 $\mu$l/g and was not significantly different from the other proteins except for NGF vs. BDNF (P {\textless} 0.05). The PS for NGF at the BBB ranged from 1.5 to 2.7 x 10-6ml/g/s for six different brain regions.

The V(p) values were not significantly different except for CNTF in the hippocampus and cortex (P {\textless} 0.05). SDS-PAGE analyses of all the radioiodinated neurotrophic proteins after 60 min of uptake revealed intact protein in the endoneurium and in the six different brain regions with exposure times of 2-42 days. The quantification of the permeability of these neurotrophic proteins provides baseline values for comparison of different protein modifications that enhance the PS while still preserving the neurotrophic activity (e.g., protein glycation). Enhanced permeability following modification might allow the use of systemic delivery of these proteins for practical therapeutic treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders.},

Between 82{\%} and 95{\%} of these cells express SGN molecular markers, they preferentially extend neurites to the cochlear nucleus rather than nonauditory nuclei, and they generate action potentials. The protocol follows an in vitro stepwise recapitulation of developmental events inherent to normal differentiation of hESCs into SGNs, resulting in efﬁ- cient sequential generation of nonneuronal ectoderm, preplacodal ectoderm, early prosensory ONPs, late ONPs, and cells with cellular and molecular characteristics of human SGNs. We thus describe the sequential signaling pathways that generate the early and later lineage species in the human SGN lineage, thereby better describing key developmental processes. The results indicate that our protocol generates cells that closely replicate the phenotypic characteristics of human SGNs, advancing the process of guiding hESCs to states serving inner-ear cell-replacement thera- pies and possible next-generation hybrid auditory prostheses.},

abstract = {In this study, we describe a strategy for the formation of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) capable of selective rebinding of protein-sized molecules and interfaced with a planar sensing surface. The strategy is based on the synergistic use of the surface-initiated controlled/living radical (C/LR) photopolymerization and microcontact imprinting approach aiming at design of a protein-responsive polymer for biosensing application. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, bis-acrylamide were used as a model protein, a functional monomer and a cross-linker, respectively, to prepare the BSA-MIP film. The optimal parameters of C/LR photopolymerization such as the method for photoinitiator attachment to the sensor surface, monomer:cross-linker molar ratio, polymerization time, were determined. The BSA-MIP film were studied in terms of their recognition capability and selectivity towards the target protein (BSA) through the analysis of the responses of the BSA-MIP modified SPR sensors upon interaction with BSA and interfering proteins, human serum albumin (HSA) and Fc-fragment of immunoglobulin G (Fc). It was found that BSA-MIP adsorbed BSA with the dissociation constant (KD) in the nanomolar range (68 nM) and shows more than two times higher adsorption capacity as compared to HSA and Fc, even though their molecular sizes were similar. Also, BSA-MIP could be perfectly regenerated in the alkaline solution showing nearly reversible responses (loss of 2.4{\%}) even after the 25th regeneration cycle. The presented simple synthesis strategy could be potentially employed for the preparation of protein-MIP films on a planar sensor transducer allowing to develop sensing systems for detection of clinically relevant proteins.},

Over the past decades, a number of neuron tracing tools including manual, semiautomatic, and fully automatic approaches have been developed to extract and analyze 3D neuronal structures. Nevertheless, most of them were developed based on coding certain rules to extract and connect structural components of a neuron, showing limited performance on complicated neuron morphology. Recently, deep learning outperforms many other machine learning methods in a wide range of image analysis and computer vision tasks. Here we developed a new Open Source toolbox, DeepNeuron, which uses deep learning networks to learn features and rules from data and trace neuron morphology in light microscopy images. DeepNeuron provides a family of modules to solve basic yet challenging problems in neuron tracing. These problems include but not limited to: (1) detecting neuron signal under different image conditions, (2) connecting neuronal signals into tree(s), (3) pruning and refining tree morphology, (4) quantifying the quality of morphology, and (5) classifying dendrites and axons in real time. We have tested DeepNeuron using light microscopy images including bright-field and confocal images of human and mouse brain, on which DeepNeuron demonstrates robustness and accuracy in neuron tracing.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration is often characterized by the spontaneous onset of multicellular protrusions (known as fingers) led by a single leader cell. Working with epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers we show that cells within the fingers, as compared with the epithelium, are well oriented and polarized along the main finger direction, which suggests that these cells actively migrate. The cell orientation and polarity decrease continuously from the tip toward the epithelium over a penetration distance of typically two finger lengths. Furthermore, laser photoablation experiments at various locations along these fingers demonstrate that the cells in the fingers are submitted to a tensile stress whose value is larger close to the tip. From a dynamical point of view, cells entering a finger gradually polarize on timescales that depend upon their particular initial position. Selective laser nanosurgery of the leader lamellipodium shows not only that these structures need a leader to progress, but that this leader itself is the consequence of a prior self-organization of the cells forming the finger. These results highlight the complex interplay between the collective orientation within the fingers and the mechanical action of the leader. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Neuronal growth cones, the sensory-motile structures at the tips of developing axons, navigate to their targets over distances that can be many times greater than their diameter. They may accomplish this impressive task by following spatial gradients of axon guidance molecules in their environment (Bonhoeffer {\&} Gierer, 1984; Tessier-Lavigne {\&} Placzek, 1991; Baier {\&} Bonhoeffer, 1994). We calculate the optimal shape of a gradient and the distance over which it can be detected by a growth cone for two competing mechanistic models of axon guidance. The results are surprisingly simple: Regardless of the mechanism, the maximum distance is about 1 cm. Since gradients and growth cones have coevolved, we suggest that the shape of the gradient in situ will predict the mechanism of gradient detection. In addition, we show that the experimentally determined dissociation constants for receptor-ligand complexes implicated in axon guidance are about optimal with respect to maximizing guidance distance. The relevance of these results to the retinotectal system is discussed.},

Circular data arises in a large variety of research fields. Among others in ecology, the medical sciences, personality measurement, educational science, sociology, and political science circular data is collected. The most direct examples of circular data within the social sciences arise in cognitive and experimental psychology. However, despite numerous examples of circular data being collected in different areas of cognitive and experimental psychology, the knowledge of this type of data is not well-spread and literature in which these types of data are analyzed using methods for circular data is relatively scarce. This paper therefore aims to give a tutorial in working with and analyzing circular data to researchers in cognitive psychology and the social sciences in general. It will do so by focusing on data inspection, model fit, estimation and hypothesis testing for two specific models for circular data using packages from the statistical programming language R.},

In this study, we investigate the extent to which these receptors can discriminate between BDNF and NGF. We found that a 1000-fold excess of the heterologous ligand is needed to reduce binding to the high-affinity receptor by 50{\%}, but that the same concentrations of BDNF and NGF similarly reduce the binding of either ligand to the low-affinity receptor. Results obtained with cells transfected with the low-affinity NGF receptor gene indicate that these cells bind BDNF, in addition to NGF, whereas cells before transfection do not. These data indicate that the low-affinity NGF receptor is also a low-affinity BDNF receptor and that whatever is conferring high-affinity binding and biological response also considerably reinforces the ability of the low-affinity receptor to discriminate between NGF and BDNF. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Background: Automatic quantification of neuronal morphology from images of fluorescence microscopy plays an increasingly important role in high-content screenings. However, there exist very few freeware tools and methods which provide automatic neuronal morphology quantification for pharmacological discovery.Results: This study proposes an effective quantification method, called NeurphologyJ, capable of automatically quantifying neuronal morphologies such as soma number and size, neurite length, and neurite branching complexity (which is highly related to the numbers of attachment points and ending points). NeurphologyJ is implemented as a plugin to ImageJ, an open-source Java-based image processing and analysis platform. The high performance of NeurphologyJ arises mainly from an elegant image enhancement method. Consequently, some morphology operations of image processing can be efficiently applied. We evaluated NeurphologyJ by comparing it with both the computer-aided manual tracing method NeuronJ and an existing ImageJ-based plugin method NeuriteTracer. Our results reveal that NeurphologyJ is comparable to NeuronJ, that the coefficient correlation between the estimated neurite lengths is as high as 0.992. NeurphologyJ can accurately measure neurite length, soma number, neurite attachment points, and neurite ending points from a single image. Furthermore, the quantification result of nocodazole perturbation is consistent with its known inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth. We were also able to calculate the IC50 of nocodazole using NeurphologyJ. This reveals that NeurphologyJ is effective enough to be utilized in applications of pharmacological discoveries.Conclusions: This study proposes an automatic and fast neuronal quantification method NeurphologyJ. The ImageJ plugin with supports of batch processing is easily customized for dealing with high-content screening applications. The source codes of NeurphologyJ (interactive and high-throughput versions) and the images used for testing are freely available (see Availability). {\textcopyright} 2011 Ho et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the insertion properties and intracochlear trajectories of three perimodiolar electrode array designs and to compare these designs with the standard Cochlear/Melbourne array. BACKGROUND: Advantages to be expected of a perimodiolar electrode array include both a reduction in stimulus thresholds and an increase in dynamic range, resulting in a more localized stimulation pattern of the spiral ganglion cells, reduced power consumption, and, therefore, longer speech processor battery life. METHODS: The test arrays were implanted into human temporal bones. Image analysis was performed on a radiograph taken after the insertion. The cochleas were then histologically processed with the electrode array in situ, and the resulting sections were subsequently assessed for position of the electrode array as well as insertion-related intracochlear damage. RESULTS: All perimodiolar electrode arrays were inserted deeper and showed trajectories that were generally closer to the modiolus compared with the standard electrode array. However, although the precurved array designs did not show significant insertion trauma, the method of insertion needed improvement. After insertion of the straight electrode array with positioner, signs of severe insertion trauma in the majority of implanted cochleas were found. CONCLUSIONS: Although it was possible to position the electrode arrays close to the modiolus, none of the three perimodiolar designs investigated fulfilled satisfactorily all three criteria of being easy, safe, and atraumatic to implant.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Speech perception scores using cochlear implants have ranged widely in all published series. The underlying determinants of suc-cess in word recognition are incompletely defined. Although it has been assumed that residual spiral ganglion cell population in the deaf ear may play a critical role, published data from temporal bone spec-imens from patients have not supported this hypoth-esis. The depth of insertion of a multichannel co-chlear implant has also been suggested as a clinical variable that may be correlated with word recogni-tion. In the current study these correlations were evaluated in 15 human subjects. Study Design: Retro-spective review of temporal bone histopathology-.Methods: Temporal bones were fixed and prepared for histological study by standard techniques. Speci-mens were then serially sectioned and reconstructed by two-dimensional methods. The spiral ganglion cells were counted, and the depth of insertion of the cochlear implant as measured from the round win-dow was determined. Correlation analyses were then performed between the NU6 word scores and spiral ganglion cell counts and the depth of insertion. Re-sults: The segmental and total spiral ganglion cell counts were not significantly correlated (P {\textgreater} .50) with NU6 word scores for the 15 subjects. Statistically sig-nificant correlations were not achieved by separate analysis of implant types. Similarly, no significant correlation between the depth of insertion of the elec-trode array and postoperative NU6 word score was identified for the group. Conclusion: Although it is unlikely that the number of residual spiral ganglion cell counts is irrelevant to the determination of word recognition following cochlear implantation, there are, clearly, other clinical variables not yet identified that play an important role in determining success with cochlear implantation. Key Words: Cochlear im-plant, depth of insertion, speech perception, spiral ganglion.},

abstract = {Neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) provide essential cues to navigate growing axon toward their targets. Concentration and concentration gradient of NGF are key parameters affecting the growth rate and direction of neurites and axons. However, the maximum distance for guided nerve growth under stimulation of a single concentration gradient is limited and is thus unfavorable in nerve regeneration. Since the sensitivity of PC12 cells to NGF signals is restorable even after brief removal of the factors, exposure to multiple concentration gradients of the factor can achieve longer distances and greater rates of guided growth. In this study, a mathematical model simulating nerve growth in a virtually constructed nerve conduit incorporating multiple NGF concentration gradients is established. Using a genetic algorithm, optimized initial profiles of NGF able to achieve 4.5 cm of guided growth with a significantly improved growth rate has been obtained. The model also predicts an inverse relationship between the diffusion coefficient of the factor and the neurite growth rate. This model provides a useful tool for evaluating various conduit designs before fabrication and evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was covalently attached to polyethylene  glycol (PEG) in order to enhance delivery to the spinal cord via the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal administration). By varying reaction conditions, mixtures of BDNF covalently attached to one (primary), two (secondary), three (tertiary), or more (higher order) PEG molecules were produced. The biological activity of each resulting conjugate mixture was assessed with the goal of identifying a relationship between the number of PEG molecules attached to BDNF and biological activity. A high degree of in vitro biological activity was maintained in mixtures enriched in primary and secondary conjugate products, while a substantial reduction in biological activity was observed in mixtures with tertiary and higher order conjugates. When a biologically active mixture of PEG-BDNF was administered intrathecally, it displayed a significantly improved half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid and an enhanced penetration into spinal cord tissue relative to native BDNF. Results from these studies suggest a PEGylation strategy that preserves the biological activity of the protein while also improving the half-life of the protein in vivo. Furthermore, PEGylation may be a promising approach for enhancing intrathecal delivery of therapeutic proteins with potential for treating disease and injury in the spinal cord.},

abstract = {Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent and are considered ideal source for regenerating damaged neural cells for neurological disorders. During culture of NSCs, both the measurement and the evaluation of their differentiation potential are important to maintain stable quality-assured NSCs for regenerative treatments since the rate of differentiation into certain lineages from NSCs is still not fully controllable. However, conventional cell evaluation techniques using biological molecular are still invasive, costly, and time-consuming. Therefore, a non-invasive, low-cost, and rapid cell evaluation method is required to expand the possibilities of regenerative therapy, especially in the facilities that produce cells for therapy. To address these such technological limitations in non-invasive cell evaluation, we propose the efficacy of computer-aided morphology-based prediction of potentials of stem cells by using multiple and time-course morphological parameters from phase-contrast microscopic images combined with experimentally determined differentiation potentials. In this work, we quantified the morphological parameters of NSCs during three types of differentiation culture and investigated two applications with NSCs: (i) evaluation of their differentiation type and (ii) early prediction of neural differentiation rate. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to non-invasively evaluate neural differentiation types and quantitatively predict future differentiation rates by using morphological information from the first 4 days. Our findings indicate the potential application of morphology-based non-invasive evaluation for optimizing effective differentiation protocols, screening of compounds to mediate NSC differentiation, and quality maintenance of regenerative medicine products.},

abstract = {Benefits of cochlear prostheses for the deaf are dependent on survival and  excitability of the auditory nerve. Degeneration of deafferented auditory nerve fibers is prevented and excitability maintained by immediate replacement therapy with exogenous neurotrophic factors, in vivo. It is important to know whether such interventions are effective after a delay following deafness, typical for the human situation. This study evaluated the efficacy of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor axokine-1 analogue (CNTF Ax1) application, 2 or 6 weeks postdeafening, in preventing further degeneration and a decrease in excitability. Guinea pigs were deafened and implanted with intracochlear stimulating electrodes, a scala tympani cannula-osmotic pump system, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) recording electrodes. Subjects received BDNF + CNTF Ax1 or artificial perilymph (AP) treatment for 27 days, beginning at 2 or 6 weeks following deafening. Electrical (E) ABR thresholds increased following deafening. After 1 week, in the 2-weeks-delayed neurotrophic factor treatment group, EABR thresholds decreased relative to AP controls, which were statistically significant at 2 weeks. In the 6-week delay group, a tendency to enhanced EABR sensitivity began at 2 weeks of treatment and increased thereafter, with a significant difference between neurotrophic factor- and AP-treated groups across the treatment period. A clear, statistically significant, enhanced survival of spiral ganglion cells was seen in both neurotrophic factor treatment groups relative to AP controls. These findings demonstrate that BDNF + CNTF Ax1 can act to delay or possibly even reverse degenerative and, likely apoptotic, processes well after they have been activated. These survival factors can rescue cells from death and enhance electrical excitability, even during the period of degeneration and cell loss when the spiral ganglion cell population is reduced by {\textgreater}50{\%} (6 weeks). It is noteworthy that this same degree of ganglion cell loss, secondary to receptor damage, is typically observed after a period equivalent to some years of deafness in humans.},

abstract = {The extension and directionality of neurite outgrowth are key to achieving successful target connections during both CNS development and during the re-establishment of connections lost after neural trauma. The degree of axonal elongation depends, in large part, on the spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes rich in growth-promoting proteins. Because astrocytes in culture align their processes on exposure to an electrical field of physiological strength, we sought to determine the extent to which aligned astrocytes affect neurite outgrowth. To this end, dorsal root ganglia cells were seeded onto cultured rat astrocytes that were prealigned by exposure to an electric field of physiological strength (500 mV mm-1). Using confocal microscopy and digital image analysis, we found that neurite outgrowth at 24 hours and at 48 hours is enhanced significantly and directed consistently along the aligned astrocyte processes. Moreover, this directed neurite outgrowth is maintained when grown on fixed, aligned astrocytes. Collectively, these results indicate that endogenous electric fields present within the developing CNS might act to align astrocyte processes, which can promote and direct neurite growth. Furthermore, these results demonstrate a simple method to produce an aligned cellular substrate, which might be used to direct regenerating neurites. {\textcopyright}2006 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {A microfluidic diffusion diluter was used to create a stable concentration gradient for dose response studies. The microfluidic diffusion diluter used in this study consisted of 128 culture chambers on each side of the main fluidic channel. A calibration method was used to find unknown concentrations with 12{\%} error. Flow rate dependent studies showed that changing the flow rates generated different gradient patterns. Mathematical simulations using COMSOL Multi-physics were performed to validate the experimental data. The experimental data obtained for the flow rate studies agreed with the simulation results. Cells could be loaded into culture chambers using vacuum actuation and cultured for long times under low shear stress. Decreasing the size of the culture chambers resulted in faster gradient formation (20 min). Mass transport into the side channels of the microfluidic diffusion diluter used in this study is an important factor in creating the gradient using diffusional mixing as a function of the distance. To demonstrate the device's utility, an H2O2 gradient was generated while culturing Ramos cells. Cell viability was assayed in the 256 culture chambers, each at a discrete H2O2 concentration. As expected, the cell viability for the high concentration side channels increased (by injecting H2O2) whereas the cell viability in the low concentration side channels decreased along the chip due to diffusional mixing as a function of distance. COMSOL simulations were used to identify the effective concentration of H2O2 for cell viability in each side chamber at 45 min. The gradient effects were confirmed using traditional H2O2 culture experiments. Viability of cells in the microfluidic device under gradient conditions showed a linear relationship with the viability of the traditional culture experiment. Development of the microfluidic device used in this study could be used to study hundreds of concentrations of a compound in a single experiment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Proteins in perilymph may alter the delivery profile of implantable  intracochlear drug delivery systems through biofouling. Knowledge of protein composition will help anticipate interactions with delivered agents. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of mouse perilymph. METHODS: Protein composition of perilymph and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed using a capillary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based iTRAQ quantitative proteomics approach. We searched against a mouse subset of the Uniprot FASTA protein database. We sampled perilymph from the apex of the mouse cochlea to minimize CSF contamination. RESULTS: More than 50 explicit protein isoforms were identified with very high confidence. iTRAQ reporter ions allowed determination of relative molar amounts of proteins between perilymph and CSF. Protein in perilymph was almost three times more concentrated than in CSF. More than one-third of the proteins in perilymph comprised protease inhibitors, with serpins being the predominant group. Apolipoproteins constituted 16{\%}. Fifteen percent of the proteins were enzymes. Albumin was the most abundant single protein (14{\%}). Proteins with relatively high perilymph/CSF ratios included broad-spectrum protease inhibitors and apolipoproteins. DISCUSSION: Some proteins found in perilymph, such as albumin and HMW kininogen, have been implicated in biofouling through adsorption to device materials. The relatively large quantities of apolipoprotein and albumin may serve as a reservoir for acidic and lipophilic drugs. Alpha-2-glycoprotein can bind basic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Perilymph is similar in protein composition to CSF, though amounts are 2.8 times higher. Protease inhibitors comprise the largest category of proteins.},

abstract = {The neural crest (NC) is a transient, multipotent, migratory cell population unique to vertebrates that gives rise to diverse cell lineages. Much of our knowledge of NC development comes from studies of organisms such as chicken and zebrafish because human NC is difficult to obtain because of its transient nature and the limited availability of human fetal cells. Here we examined the process of NC induction from human pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We showed that NC cells could be efficiently induced from hESCs by a  combination of growth factors in medium conditioned on stromal cells and that NC stem cells (NCSCs) could be purified by p75 using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). FACS-isolated NCSCs could be propagated in vitro in five passages and cryopreserved while maintaining NCSC identity characterized by the expression of a panel of NC markers such as p75, Sox9, Sox10, CD44, and HNK1. In vitro-expanded NCSCs were able to differentiate into neurons and glia (Schwann cells) of the peripheral nervous system, as well as mesenchymal derivatives. hESC-derived NCSCs appeared to behave similarly to endogenous embryonic NC cells when injected in chicken embryos. Using a defined medium, we were able to generate and propagate a nearly pure population of Schwann cells that uniformly expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100, and p75. Schwann cells generated by our protocol myelinated rat dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first report on myelination by hESC- or iPSC-derived Schwann cells. {\textcopyright} AlphaMed Press.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was modified by carboxyl-directed protein pegylation in order to both retain biologic activity of the neurotrophin and reduce the rate of systemic clearance of this cationic protein in vivo. Since the modification of surface lysine residues of neurotrophins results in loss of biologic activity, the present studies examine the feasibility of placing polyethyleneglycol (PEG) polymers on carboxyl residues of surface glutamate or aspartate residues of BDNF. METHODS: PEG molecules with terminal hydrazide (Hz) moieties of molecular weight 2,000 (PEG2000-Hz) or 5,000 (PEG5000-Hz) Daltons were coupled to BDNF carboxyls using carbodiimide. RESULTS: The systemic clearances of the BDNF-PEG2000 and BDNF-PEG5000 were reduced 67{\%} and 91{\%}, respectively, compared to unconjugated BDNF. The brain volume of distribution (VD) of BDNF-PEG5000 was not significantly different from the cerebral plasma volume. Cell survival studies and TrkB auto-phosphorylation assays showed that the biologic activity of BDNF was not changed following pegylation with PEG2000, and was minimally impaired following pegylation with PEG5000. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments describe the first carboxyl-directed pegylation of a neuropeptide, and show this formulation substantially reduces the systemic distribution and elimination of the neurotrophic factor. The biologic activity of the neurotrophin is retained with carboxyl-directed pegylation.},

However, the amount of the protein of interest expressed tends to decrease in the later stages of infection presumably due, in part, to a proteinase produced in the larval haemolymph. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of a proteinase purified from the haemolymph of BmNPV-infected larvae was identical to the internal amino acid sequence of the viral cysteine proteinase gene of BmNPV, suggesting that the cysteine proteinase in the haemolymph originated from the BmNPV gene. We constructed a mutant virus (CPd) which had a deletion in the cysteine proteinase gene. No proteinase activity corresponding to this proteinase was detected in the haemolymph of silkworm larvae infected with CPd. The firefly luciferase and the human growth hormone genes were separately introduced into CPd under control of the polyhedrin promoter. These constructs produced these proteins very efficiently, because of a greatly reduced degree of degradation of these proteins. A BmNPV vector system using CPd enhances the stability of foreign expressed proteins, especially for those that are cysteine proteinase-sensitive.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration is an essential phenomenon in many naturally occurring pathophysiological processes, as well as in tissue engineering applications. Cells in tissues and organs are known to sense chemical and mechanical signals from the microenvironment and collectively respond to these signals. For the last few decades, the effiects of chemical signals such as growth factors and therapeutic agents on collective cell behaviors in the context of tissue engineering have been extensively studied, whereas those of the mechanical cues have only recently been investigated. The mechanical signals can be presented to the constituent cells in diffierent forms, including topography, substrate stiffiness, and geometrical constraint. With the recent advancement in microfabrication technology, researchers have gained the ability to manipulate the geometrical constraints by creating 3D structures to mimic the tissue microenvironment. In this study, we simulate the pore curvature as presented to the cells within 3D-engineered tissue-scaffiolds by developing a device that features tortuous microchannels with geometric variations. We show that both cells at the front and rear respond to the varying radii of curvature and channel amplitude by altering the collective migratory behavior, including cell velocity, morphology, and turning angle. These findings provide insights into adaptive migration modes of collective cells to better understand the underlying mechanism of cell migration for optimization of the engineered tissue-scaffiold design.},

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, are broadly expressed in the developing and adult mammalian brain. BDNF/TrkB-stimulated intracellular signaling is critical for neuronal survival, morphogenesis, and plasticity. It is well known that binding of BDNF to TrkB elicits various intracellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), phospholipase C$\gamma$ (PLC$\gamma$), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, and that BDNF exerts biological effects on neurons via activation of similar mechanisms. In addition to TrkB, a low-affinity receptor p75 is also involved in neuronal survival and plasticity. BDNF affects neurons positively or negatively through various intracellular signaling pathways triggered by activation of TrkB or p75. From a clinical standpoint, roles of BDNF have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various brain diseases. The stress-induced steroid hormone, glucocorticoid, and BDNF are putatively associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Recent reports, including our studies, demonstrate possible crosstalk between glucocorticoid- and BDNF/TrkB-mediated signaling. Here, we present a broad overview of the current knowledge concerning BDNF action and associated intracellular signaling as it relates to neuronal protection, synaptic function, and morphological change. Furthermore, understanding the secretion and intracellular dynamics of BDNF proteins is critical as the fate of secreted BDNF may contribute to differences in neuronal response.},

In addition to its unstable and adhesive nature, BDNF can activate p75NTR, a receptor mediating cellular functions opposite to those of TrkB. We have now identified TrkB agonistic antibodies (TrkB-agoAbs) with several properties superior to BDNF: They exhibit blood half-life of days instead of hours, diffuse centimeters in neural tissues instead millimeters, and bind and activate TrkB, but not p75NTR. In addition, TrkB-agoAbs elicit much longer TrkB activation, reduced TrkB internalization and less intracellular degradation, compared with BDNF. More importantly, some of these TrkB-agoAbs bind TrkB epitopes distinct from that by BDNF, and work cooperatively with endogenous BDNF. Unlike BDNF, the TrkB-agoAbs exhibit a half-life of days/weeks and diffused readily in nerve tissues. We tested one of TrkB-agoAbs further and showed that it enhanced motoneuron survival in the spinal-root avulsion model for motoneuron degeneration in vivo.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review central nervous system growth factors and their therapeutic potential and clinical translation into spinal cord injury (SCI), as well as the challenges that have been encountered during clinical development. METHODS: A systemic review of the available current and historical literature regarding central nervous system growth factors and clinical trials regarding their use in spinal cord injury was conducted. RESULTS: The effectiveness of administering growth factors as a potential therapeutic strategy for SCI has been tested with the use of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin 3, and neurotrophin-4/5. Delivery of growth factors to injured SC has been tested by numerous methods. Unfortunately, most of clinical trials at this time are uncontrolled and have questionable results because of lack of efficacy and/or unacceptable side effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is promise in the use of specific growth factors therapeutically for SCI. However, more studies involving neuronal regeneration and functional recovery are needed, as well the development of delivery methods that allow sufficient quantity of growth factors while restricting their distribution to target sites.},

Melanocytes were observed to reside at the base of the 3D cell culture and melanin was also typically observed in the lower layer. The 3D cell culture model with FGF-2 and FGF-7 polyhedra was a useful in vitro model of the epidermis due to effective melanogenesis, proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. FGF-7 polyhedra showed a potent cytoprotective effect when keratinocytes were treated with menadione, which is a generator of reactive oxygen species. The cytoprotective effect was activated by the inositol triphosphate kinase-Akt pathway leading to upregulation of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin 6.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the fabrication of a compartmentalized microfluidic device with docking sites to position a single neuron or a cluster of 5–6 neurons along with varying length of microgrooves and the optimization process for culturing primary mammalian neurons at low densities. The principle of centrifugation was employed to situate cells in desired locations followed by the application of a fluid flow to remove the extra or unwanted cells lying in the vicinity of the located neurons. The neuronal cell density was optimized by seeding 103 cells and 104 cells/microfluidic device. The speed of centrifugation was optimized as 1500 rpm for 1 min and a cell density of greater than or equal to 104 cells/microfluidic device was found to be suitable for loading maximum number of docking sites. The outcomes of the simulated experiments was found to be in compliance with the experimemtal verifications. Furthermore, the cells cultured within the microfluidic device were assessed for immunocytochemical staining and the axonal growth was quantified with the help of an Axofluidic software. Although, several in vitro microfluidic platforms have been developed that facilitate the investigations where communication between neurons or between neurons and other cell types is concerned, none of the partitioned devices so far has reported the presence of docking sites along with an array of grooves of varying lengths. These physically connected but fluidically isolated compartmentalized microfluidic devices may serve us in analysing the activity of a low density of neurons and the influence of axonal length in setting up a communication with other cell type.This platform is useful to gain insights into the processes of synapse formation, axonal guidance, cell-cell interaction, to name a few.},

abstract = {The survival, differentiation, and maintenance of responsive neurons are regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), which is secreted by the target and interacts with receptors on the axon tip. It is uncertain how the NGF signal is communicated retrogradely from distal axons to neuron cell bodies. Retrograde transport of activated receptors in endocytic vesicles could convey the signal. However, little is known about endocytosis of NGF receptors, and there is no evidence that NGF receptors continue to signal after endocytosis. We have examined early events in the membrane traffic of NGF and its receptor, gp140(TrkA) (TrkA), in PC12 cells. NGF induced rapid and extensive endocytosis of TrkA in these cells, and the receptor subsequently moved into small organelles located near the plasma membrane. Some of these organelles contained clathrin and $\alpha$-adaptin, which implies that TrkA is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Using mechanical permeabilization and fractionation, intracellular organelles derived from endocytosis were separated from the plasma membrane. After NGF treatment, NGF was bound to TrkA in endocytic organelles, and TrkA was tyrosine- phosphorylated and bound to PLC-$\gamma$1, suggesting that these receptors were competent to initiate signal transduction. These studies raise the possibility that NGF induces formation of signaling endosomes containing activated TrkA. They are an important first step in elucidating the molecular mechanism of NGF retrograde signaling.},

@article{Burgess2010,
abstract = {Here we show that the functional human ortholog of Greatwall protein kinase (Gwl) is the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like protein, MAST-L. This kinase promotes mitotic entry and maintenance in human cells by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a phosphatase that dephosphorylates cyclin B-Cdc2 substrates. The complete depletion of Gwl by siRNA arrests human cells in G2. When the levels of this kinase are only partially depleted, however, cells enter into mitosis with multiple defects and fail to inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The ability of cells to remain arrested in mitosis by the SAC appears to be directly proportional to the amount of Gwl remaining. Thus, when Gwl is only slightly reduced, cells arrest at prometaphase. More complete depletion correlates with the premature dephosphorylation of cyclin B-Cdc2 substrates, inactivation of the SAC, and subsequent exit from mitosis with severe cytokinesis defects. These phenotypes appear to be mediated by PP2A, as they could be rescued by either a double Gwl/PP2A knockdown or by the inhibition of this phosphatase with okadaic acid. These results suggest that the balance between cyclin B-Cdc2 and PP2A must be tightly regulated for correct mitotic entry and exit and that Gwl is crucial for mediating this regulation in somatic human cells.},

abstract = {Transgenic mice overexpressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor from the beta-actin  promoter were tested for behavioral, gross anatomical and physiological abnormalities. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA overexpression was widespread throughout brain. Overexpression declined with age, such that levels of overexpression decreased sharply by nine months. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor transgenic mice had no gross deformities or behavioral abnormalities. However, they showed a significant passive avoidance deficit. This deficit was dependent on continued overexpression, and resolved with age as brain-derived neurotrophic factor transcripts decreased. In addition, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor transgenic mice showed increased seizure severity in response to kainic acid. Hippocampal slices from brain-derived neurotrophic factor transgenic mice showed hyperexcitability in area CA3 and entorhinal cortex, but not in dentate gyrus. Finally, area CA1 long-term potentiation was disrupted, indicating abnormal plasticity. Our data suggest that overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the brain can interfere with normal brain function by causing learning impairments and increased excitability. The results also support the hypothesis that excess brain-derived neurotrophic factor could be pro-convulsant in the limbic system.},

BDNF mRNA expression was highest in the cochlea at GW 9 but declined in the course of development. In contrast to embryonic murine specimens, a decline in BDNF expression from the apical to the basal turn of the cochlea could not be observed. p75NTR immunostaining was most prominent in the nerve fibers that penetrate into the sensory epithelia of the cochlea, the urticule and the saccule as gestational age progresses. TrkB and TrkC expression intensified towards GW 12, at which point the BDNF mRNA localization was at its lowest. TrkA expression was limited to fiber subpopulations of the facial nerve at GW 10. In the adult human inner ear, we observed BDNF mRNA expression in the apical poles of the cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, while in the adult human utricle, the expression was localized in the vestibular hair cells. We demonstrate the highly specific staining patterns of BDNF mRNA and its putative receptors over a developmental period in which multiple hearing disorders are manifested. Our findings suggest that BDNF and neurotrophin receptors are important players during early human inner ear development. In particular, they seem to be important for the survival of the afferent sensory neurons.},

abstract = {The complexity of the human brain poses a substantial challenge for the development of models of the CNS. Current animal models lack many essential human characteristics (in addition to raising operational challenges and ethical concerns), and conventional in vitro models, in turn, are limited in their capacity to provide information regarding many functional and systemic responses. Indeed, these challenges may underlie the notoriously low success rates of CNS drug development efforts. During the past 5 years, there has been a leap in the complexity and functionality of in vitro systems of the CNS, which have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of traditional model systems. The availability of human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell technology has further increased the translational potential of these systems. Yet, the adoption of state-of-the-art in vitro platforms within the CNS research community is limited. This may be attributable to the high costs or the immaturity of the systems. Nevertheless, the costs of fabrication have decreased, and there are tremendous ongoing efforts to improve the quality of cell differentiation. Herein, we aim to raise awareness of the capabilities and accessibility of advanced in vitro CNS technologies. We provide an overview of some of the main recent developments (since 2015) in in vitro CNS models. In particular, we focus on engineered in vitro models based on cell culture systems combined with microfluidic platforms (e.g. 'organ-on-a-chip' systems). We delve into the fundamental principles underlying these systems and review several applications of these platforms for the study of the CNS in health and disease. Our discussion further addresses the challenges that hinder the implementation of advanced in vitro platforms in personalized medicine or in large-scale industrial settings, and outlines the existing differentiation protocols and industrial cell sources. We conclude by providing practical guidelines for laboratories that are considering adopting organ-on-a-chip technologies.},

Accurate targeting of the entorhinal cortex in AD is complex due to the deep and atrophic state of this brain region. Using MRI-guided methods with convection-enhanced delivery, we were able to accurately and consistently target AAV2-BDNF delivery to the entorhinal cortex of non-human primates; 86 ± 3{\%} of transduced cells in the targeted regions co-localized with the neuronal marker NeuN. The volume of AAV2-BDNF (3 × 10(8) vg/µl) infusion linearly correlated with the number of BDNF labeled cells and the volume (mm(3)) of BDNF immunoreactivity in the entorhinal cortex. BDNF is normally trafficked to the hippocampus from the entorhinal cortex; in these experiments, we also found that BDNF immunoreactivity was elevated in the hippocampus following therapeutic BDNF vector delivery to the entorhinal cortex, achieving growth factor distribution through key memory circuits. These findings indicate that MRI-guided infusion of AAV2-BDNF to the entorhinal cortex of the non-human primate results in safe and accurate targeting and distribution of BDNF to both the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. These methods are adaptable to human clinical trials.},

abstract = {This expert review offers a critical synthesis of the latest insights and approaches at targeting the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway in various cancers such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and breast and lung cancers. Notably, from organogenesis to cancer, the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling displays varied and highly versatile biological functions in animals, with virtually all tissues requiring the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling in one way or the other. Aberrant expression of the members of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin has been implicated in many pathological conditions, particularly in human cancers. Mutations in the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway genes have been noted in diverse cancers. Biochemical and genetic data support the idea that inhibition of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling is beneficial in cancer therapeutics. The interaction of this important pathway with other signaling systems is also noteworthy, but remains as an area for further research and discovery. In addition, formation of different complexes by components of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway and the precise roles of these complexes in the cytoplasmic milieu are yet to be fully elucidated. This article highlights the latest medical technologies in imaging, single-cell omics, use of artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning techniques), genome sequencing, quantum computing, molecular docking, and computational softwares in modeling interactions between molecules and predicting protein-protein and compound-protein interactions pertinent to the biology and therapeutic value of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway. We discuss these emerging technologies in relationship to what is currently needed to move from concept to actionable strategies in translating the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin laboratory discoveries to Wnt-targeted cancer therapies and diagnostics in the clinic.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Central processes of the bipolar neurons in the spiral ganglion converge in the modiolus to form the initial portion of the auditory branch (cochlear nerve) of the eighth cranial nerve. This occurs before the cochlear nerve passes through the internal auditory meatus. The neurons of the spiral ganglion send their central processes towards the internal acoustic meatus, through a single canal to form the cochlear nerve. These processes are described in many textbooks as running through numerous longitudinal small canals called canales longitudinales modioli before entering the internal acoustic meatus. Results of this study indicated that the term; "canalis longitudinalis modioli" was considered to be more appropriate than the former. METHODS: Central processes of the bipolar neurons in the spiral ganglion of the guinea pig and human cochleae were investigated using stereo, light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Detailed examination of the guinea pig and human cochleae by light, electron and stereomicroscopy did not reveal multiple longitudinal canals but a single canal for the cochlear nerve. CONCLUSIONS: The singular term canalis longitudinalis modioli is more appropriate than canales longitudinales modioli.},

However, these tests were designed for continuously distributed data, whereas often (e.g. due to limited precision of measurement techniques) collected data is aggregated into a set of discrete values (e.g. rounded to the nearest degree). This disparity can cause an uncontrolled increase in type I error rate, an effect that is particularly problematic for tests that are based on the distribution of arc lengths between adjacent points (such as the Rao spacing test). Here, we demonstrate that an easy-to-apply modification can correct this problem, and we recommend this modification when using any test, other than the Rayleigh test, of circular uniformity on aggregated data. We provide R functions for this modification for several commonly used tests. In addition, we tested the power of a recently proposed test, the Gini test. However, we concluded that it lacks sufficient increase in power to replace any of the tests already in common use. In conclusion, using any of the standard circular tests (except the Rayleigh test) without modifications on rounded/aggregated data, especially with larger sample sizes, will increase the proportion of false-positive results—but we demonstrate that a simple and general modification avoids this problem. Significance statement: Circular data are widespread across biological disciplines, e.g. in orientation studies or circadian rhythms. Often these data are rounded to the nearest 1–10 degrees. We have shown previously that this leads to an inflation of false-positive results when testing whether the data is significantly different from a random distribution using the Rao test. Here we present a modification that avoids this increase in false-positives for rounded data while retaining statistical power for a variety of tests. In sum, we provide comprehensive guidance on how best to test for departure from uniformity in non-continuous data.},

By solving the neuronal classification problem, we can further understand the characteristics of neurons and the process of information transmission. This paper presents a neuronal morphology classification approach based on locally cumulative connected deep neural networks, where 43 geometric features were extracted from two different neuron datasets and applied to classify types of neurons. Then, the effects of different parameters of deep learning networks on the performance of neuron classification were analyzed including mini-batch size, number of intermediate layers, and number of building blocks. The accuracy of the approach was also compared with that of the other mainstream machine learning approaches.

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, are broadly expressed in the developing and adult mammalian brain. BDNF/TrkB-stimulated intracellular signaling is critical for neuronal survival, morphogenesis, and plasticity. It is well known that binding of BDNF to TrkB elicits various intracellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), phospholipase C$\gamma$ (PLC$\gamma$), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, and that BDNF exerts biological effects on neurons via activation of similar mechanisms. In addition to TrkB, a low-affinity receptor p75 is also involved in neuronal survival and plasticity. BDNF affects neurons positively or negatively through various intracellular signaling pathways triggered by activation of TrkB or p75. From a clinical standpoint, roles of BDNF have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various brain diseases. The stress-induced steroid hormone, glucocorticoid, and BDNF are putatively associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Recent reports, including our studies, demonstrate possible crosstalk between glucocorticoid- and BDNF/TrkB-mediated signaling. Here, we present a broad overview of the current knowledge concerning BDNF action and associated intracellular signaling as it relates to neuronal protection, synaptic function, and morphological change. Furthermore, understanding the secretion and intracellular dynamics of BDNF proteins is critical as the fate of secreted BDNF may contribute to differences in neuronal response.},

abstract = {Objective. Direct electrical stimulation of the brain through intracranial electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic brain as part of pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being considered for therapeutic treatments through neuromodulation. In order to effectively modulate neural activity, a given neuromodulation design must elicit similar responses throughout the course of treatment. However, it is unknown whether intracranial electrical stimulation responses are consistent across sessions. The objective of this study was to investigate the within-subject, cross-session consistency of the electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered through intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Approach. We analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with iEEG who underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory experiment. We quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a reference, we made the same measurements during baseline periods. Main results. In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band power could not be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of band power. Stimulation effect was consistent in a third of the session pairs, while the rest had a consistency measure not exceeding the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency was highly correlated with the degree of band power increase, and it also tended to be higher when the baseline conditions were more similar between sessions. Significance. These findings can inform our practices for designing neuromodulation with greater efficacy when using direct electrical brain stimulation as a therapeutic treatment.},

New imaging techniques are allowing the circuit mechanisms underlying orientation and direction selectivity to be studied with clarity that was not possible a decade ago. However, these new techniques bring new challenges: robust quantitative measurements are needed to evaluate the findings from these studies, which can involve thousands of cells of varying response strength. Here we show that traditional measures of selectivity such as the orientation index (OI) and direction index (DI) are poorly suited for quantitative evaluation of orientation and direction tuning. We explore several alternative methods for quantifying tuning and for addressing a variety of questions that arise in studies on orientation- and direction-tuned cells and cell populations. We provide recommendations for which methods are best suited to which applications and we offer tips for avoiding potential pitfalls in applying these methods. Our goal is to supply a solid quantitative foundation for studies involving orientation and direction tuning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mazurek, Kager and Van Hooser.},

abstract = {The sense of hearing depends on the faithful transmission of sound information from the ear to the brain by spiral ganglion (SG) neurons. However, how SG neurons develop the connections and properties that underlie auditory processing is largely unknown. We catalogued gene expression in mouse SG neurons from embryonic day 12, when SG neurons first extend projections, up until postnatal day 15, after the onset of hearing. For comparison, we also analyzed the closely related vestibular ganglion (VG). Gene ontology analysis confirmed enriched expression of genes associated with gene regulation and neurite outgrowth at early stages, with the SG and VG often expressing different members of the same gene family. At later stages, the neurons transcribe more genes related to mature function, and exhibit a dramatic increase in immune gene expression. Comparisons of the two populations revealed enhanced expression of TGF/3 pathway components in SG neurons and established new markers that consistently distinguish auditory and vestibular neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that Gata3, a transcription factor commonly associated with auditory development, is also expressed in VG neurons at early stages. We therefore defined new cohorts of transcription factors and axon guidance molecules that are uniquely expressed in SG neurons and may drive auditory-specific aspects of their differentiation and wiring. We show that one of these molecules, the receptor guanylyl cyclase Npr2, is required for bifurcation of the SG central axon. Hence, our dataset provides a useful resource for uncovering the molecular basis of specific auditory circuit assembly events. {\textcopyright} 2011 the authors.},

abstract = {Automated microscopy has given researchers access to great amounts of live cell imaging data from in vitro and in vivo experiments. Much focus has been put on extracting cell tracks from such data using a plethora of segmentation and tracking algorithms, but further analysis is normally required to draw biologically relevant conclusions. Such relevant conclusions may be whether the migration is directed or not, whether the population has homogeneous or heterogeneous migration patterns. This review focuses on the analysis of cell migration data that are extracted from time lapse images. We discuss a range of measures and models used to analyze cell tracks independent of the biological system or the way the tracks were obtained. For single-cell migration, we focus on measures and models giving examples of biological systems where they have been applied, for example, migration of bacteria, fibroblasts, and immune cells. For collective migration, we describe the model systems wound healing, neural crest migration, and Drosophila gastrulation and discuss methods for cell migration within these systems. We also discuss the role of the extracellular matrix and subsequent differences between track analysis in vitro and in vivo. Besides methods and measures, we are putting special focus on the need for openly available data and code, as well as a lack of common vocabulary in cell track analysis. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

abstract = {Objectives: The main objective of this study was to measure the vibrotactile thresholds on the mastoid process and forehead positions using patients with bilateral deafness and to compare the results from the two bone conduction vibrators Radioear B71 and B81. Design: There is a possibility that the vibrotactile sensation on the skin makes it difficult to discriminate between sound and vibration. The risk is highest for patients who have bone conduction hearing thresholds in proximity to or worse than their vibrotactile thresholds. All measurements were performed similar to regular bone conduction threshold testing using an audiometer-driven bone conduction vibrator and pulsed warble tones, but the patients were instructed to respond only when feeling vibrations of the bone conduction vibrator instead of when hearing sound. Both the posterior forehead position and the mastoid process position on the temporal bone were tested for comparative reasons. In total, 16 patients participated in the study, 31{\%} females and 69{\%} males of age 29 to 77 years. All subjects were cochlear implant recipients, either uni- or bilaterally implanted. They were selected based on their audiogram data showing unmeasurable unaided hearing. Results: The force level at which the vibrotactile thresholds were reached, increased with frequency from 125 up to 500 Hz, but remained constant for higher frequencies up to 2 kHz. A statistically significant difference was found between the 2 devices at 125 Hz at both the mastoid process and forehead position, where the vibrotactile threshold seem to be more sensitive for B71, possibly due to contribution of distortion components. There was no statistically significant difference in vibrotactile thresholds between the mastoid process and forehead position in absolute values (force level in dB re 1 µN), but in terms of hearing levels (dB HL) there was an average difference of 10 and 9 dB for B71 and B81, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicate that the vibrotactile thresholds can be confounded with bone conduction hearing thresholds measurements up to 500 Hz when using a standard audiometer and in particular when measuring on the forehead position.},

To address this challenge, we developed a soft-lithography-fabricated microfluidic platform that enabled one single device to be used as a concentration maker, which could generate linear, bell-type, or even S-type concentration profiles by tuning the feed flow rate ratios of each independent inlet. Here, we present an FFRR (feed flow rate ratio) adjustment approach to generate tens of types of concentration gradient profiles with one single device. To demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we used a Christmas-tree-like microfluidic chip as the demo. Its performance was analyzed using numerical simulation models and experimental investigations, and it showed an excellent time response ({\~{}}10 s).

abstract = {Bone-conduction transducers for hearing aids are used by thousands of pa- tients that cannot use conventional air-conduction hearing devices. Such bone conduction transducers have also been extensively used in bone con- duction audiometry, for example, hearing threshold measurements. The in- teraction between these transducers output impedance and the patients skin impedance over the temporal bone, which both are in the same range, re- sults in a high variability of the output force, acceleration and power which is directly related to the variability in the patients skin impedances. Because the output force is used as the reference zero standard for bone conduction hearing thresholds, variability in patient skin impedances is a source of error in threshold determination via bone conduction. This work investigates the extent of this variability in the output from one Radioear B71 transducer due to the skin impedances of 30 subjects. In the frequency range 100-10000 Hz, an inter subject standard deviation in the skin impedance, averaging 2.4 dB, gives rise to a standard deviation in force and acceleration output ranging from 0 - 5 dB. The impedance characteristic of the transducer can be used to predict which frequency regions correspond to increased output variability, as well as to ?nd "golden" frequency areas having less force and acceleration output variability.},

abstract = {Cochlear implant (CI) is a successful device to restore hearing. Despite continuous development, frequency discrimination is poor in CI users due to an anatomical gap between the auditory neurons and CI electrode causing current spread and unspecific neural stimulation. One strategy to close this anatomical gap is guiding the growth of neuron dendrites closer to CI electrodes through targeted slow release of neurotrophins. Biodegradable calcium phosphate hollow nanospheres (CPHSs) were produced and their capacity for uptake and release of neurotrophins investigated using 125I-conjugated glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The CPHSs were coated onto CI electrodes and loaded with neurotrophins. Axon guidance effect of slow-released neurotrophins from the CPHSs was studied in an in??vitro 3D culture model. CPHS coating bound and released GDNF with an association rate constant 6.3??????103??M???1s???1 and dissociation rate 2.6??????10???5??s???1, respectively. Neurites from human vestibulocochlear ganglion explants found and established physical contact with the GDNF-loaded CPHS coating on the CI electrodes placed 0.7??mm away. Our results suggest that neurotrophin delivery through CPHS coating is a plausible way to close the anatomical gap between auditory neurons and electrodes. By overcoming this gap, selective neural activation and the fine hearing for CI users become possible.},

abstract = {Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the target cells of the cochlear implant, undergo gradual degeneration following loss of the sensory epithelium in deafness. The preservation of a viable population of SGNs in deafness can be achieved in animal models with exogenous application of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3. For translation into clinical application, a suitable delivery strategy that provides ongoing neurotrophic support and promotes long-term SGN survival is required. Cell-based neurotrophin treatment has the potential to meet the specific requirements for clinical application, and we have previously reported that Schwann cells genetically modified to express BDNF can support SGN survival in deafness for 4. weeks. This study aimed to investigate various parameters important for the development of a long-term cell-based neurotrophin treatment to support SGN survival. Specifically, we investigated different (i) cell types, (ii) gene transfer methods and (iii) neurotrophins, in order to determine which variables may provide long-term neurotrophin expression and which, therefore, may be the most effective for supporting long-term SGN survival in vivo. We found that fibroblasts that were nucleofected to express BDNF provided the most sustained neurotrophin expression, with ongoing BDNF expression for at least 30. weeks. In addition, the secreted neurotrophin was biologically active and elicited survival effects on SGNs in vitro. Nucleofected fibroblasts may therefore represent a method for safe, long-term delivery of neurotrophins to the deafened cochlea to support SGN survival in deafness. ?? 2014 IBRO.},

abstract = {A spinal cord injury can damage neuronal connections required for both motor and sensory function. Barriers to regeneration within the central nervous system, including an absence of neurotrophic stimulation, impair the ability of injured neurons to reestablish their original circuitry. Exogenous neurotrophin administration has been shown to promote axonal regeneration and outgrowth following injury. The neurotrophins possess chemotrophic properties that guide axons toward the region of highest concentration. These growth factors have demonstrated potential to be used as a therapeutic intervention for orienting axonal growth beyond the injury lesion, toward denervated targets. However, the success of this approach is dependent on the appropriate spatiotemporal distribution of these molecules to ensure detection and navigation by the axonal growth cone. A number of in vitro gradient-based assays have been employed to investigate axonal response to neurotrophic gradients. Such platforms have helped elucidate the potential of applying a concentration gradient of neurotrophins to promote directed axonal regeneration toward a functionally significant target. Here, we review these techniques and the principles of gradient detection in axonal guidance, with particular focus on the use of neurotrophins to orient the trajectory of regenerating axons.},

abstract = {Cellular alignment plays a critical role in functional, physical, and biological characteristics of many tissue types, such as muscle, tendon, nerve, and cornea. Current efforts toward regeneration of these tissues include replicating the cellular microenvironment by developing biomaterials that facilitate cellular alignment. To assess the functional effectiveness of the engineered microenvironments, one essential criterion is quantification of cellular alignment. Therefore, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and adaptable methodologies to quantify cellular alignment for tissue engineering applications. To address this need, we developed an automated method, binarization-based extraction of alignment score (BEAS), to determine cell orientation distribution in a wide variety of microscopic images. This method combines a sequenced application of median and band-pass filters, locally adaptive thresholding approaches and image processing techniques. Cellular alignment score is obtained by applying a robust scoring algorithm to the orientation distribution. We validated the BEAS method by comparing the results with the existing approaches reported in literature (i.e., manual, radial fast Fourier transform-radial sum, and gradient based approaches). Validation results indicated that the BEAS method resulted in statistically comparable alignment scores with the manual method (coefficient of determination R2=0.92). Therefore, the BEAS method introduced in this study could enable accurate, convenient, and adaptable evaluation of engineered tissue constructs and biomaterials in terms of cellular alignment and organization. {\textcopyright} 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Integration of stem cell-derived neurons into the central nervous system (CNS)  remains a challenge. A co-culture system is developed to understand whether mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived spiral ganglion neuron (SGN)-like cells (ESNs) synapse with native mouse cochlear nucleus (CN) neurons. A Cre system is used to generate Cop-GFP ESCs, which are induced into ESNs expressing features similar to auditory SGNs. Neural connections are observed between ESNs and CN neurons 4-6 days after co-culturing, which is stimulated by thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). Antagonist and loss-of-function small hairpin RNA studies indicate that the $\alpha$2$\delta$1 receptor is critical for TSP1-induced synaptogenesis effects. Newly generated synapse-like structures express pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Synaptic vesicle recycling, pair recording, and blocker electrophysiology suggest functional synaptic vesicles, transsynaptic activities, and formation of glutamatergic synapses. These results demonstrate the synaptogenesis capability of ESNs, which is important for pluripotent ESC-derived neurons to form functional synaptic connections to CNS neurons.},

@article{Hahnewald2016,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cochlear implants (CIs) have become the gold standard treatment for deafness. These neuroprosthetic devices feature a linear electrode array, surgically inserted into the cochlea, and function by directly stimulating the auditory neurons located within the spiral ganglion, bypassing lost or not-functioning hair cells. Despite their success, some limitations still remain, including poor frequency resolution and high-energy consumption. In both cases, the anatomical gap between the electrode array and the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) is believed to be an important limiting factor. The final goal of the study is to characterize response profiles of SGNs growing in intimate contact with an electrode array, in view of designing novel CI devices and stimulation protocols, featuring a gapless interface with auditory neurons. APPROACH: We have characterized SGN responses to extracellular stimulation using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs). This setup allows, in our view, to optimize in vitro many of the limiting interface aspects between CIs and SGNs. MAIN RESULTS: Early postnatal mouse SGN explants were analyzed after 6-18 days in culture. Different stimulation protocols were compared with the aim to lower the stimulation threshold and the energy needed to elicit a response. In the best case, a four-fold reduction of the energy was obtained by lengthening the biphasic stimulus from 40 $\mu$s to 160 $\mu$s. Similarly, quasi monophasic pulses were more effective than biphasic pulses and the insertion of an interphase gap moderately improved efficiency. Finally, the stimulation with an external electrode mounted on a micromanipulator showed that the energy needed to elicit a response could be reduced by a factor of five with decreasing its distance from 40 $\mu$m to 0 $\mu$m from the auditory neurons. SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to show electrical activity of SGNs on MEAs. Our findings may help to improve stimulation by and to reduce energy consumption of CIs and thereby contribute to the development of fully implantable devices with better auditory resolution in the future.},

abstract = {This paper compares the ability of some simple model functions to describe orientation tuning curves obtained in extracellular single-unit recordings from area 17 of the cat visual cortex. It also investigates the relationships between three methods currently used to estimate preferred orientation from tuning curve data: (a) least-squares curve fitting, (b) the vector sum method and (c) the Fourier transform method (W{\"{o}}rg{\"{o}}tter and Eysel 1987). The results show that the best fitting model function for single-unit orientation tuning curves is a von Mises circular function with a variable degree of skewness. However, other functions, such as a wrapped Gaussian, fit the data nearly as well. A cosine function provides a poor description of tuning curves in almost all instances. It is demonstrated that the vector sum and Fourier methods of determining preferred orientation are equivalent, and identical to calculating a least-square fit of a cosine function to the data. Least-squares fitting of a better model function, such as a von Mises function or a wrapped Gaussian, is therefore likely to be a better method for estimating preferred orientation. Monte-Carlo simulations confirmed this, although for broad orientation tuning curves sampled at 45° intervals, as is typical in optical recording experiments, all the methods gave similarly accurate estimates of preferred orientation. The sampling interval, the estimated error in the response measurements and the probable shape of the underlying response function all need to be taken into account in deciding on the best method of estimating preferred orientation from physiological measurements of orientation tuning data.},

abstract = {Multiplexing, labeling for multiple immunostains in the very same cell or tissue section in situ, has raised considerable interest. The methods proposed include the use of labeled primary antibodies, spectral separation of fluorochromes, bleaching of the fluorophores or chromogens, blocking of previous antibody layers, all in various combinations. The major obstacles to the diffusion of this technique are high costs in custom antibodies and instruments, low throughput, and scarcity of specialized skills or facilities. We have validated a method based on common primary and secondary antibodies and diffusely available fluorescent image scanners. It entails rounds of four-color indirect immunofluorescence, image acquisition, and removal (stripping) of the antibodies, before another stain is applied. The images are digitally registered and the autofluorescence is subtracted. Removal of antibodies is accomplished by disulfide cleavage and a detergent or by a chaotropic salt treatment, this latter followed by antigen refolding. More than 30 different antibody stains can be applied to one single section from routinely fixed and embedded tissue. This method requires a modest investment in hardware and materials and uses freeware image analysis software. Multiplexing on routine tissue sections is a high throughput tool for in situ characterization of neoplastic, reactive, inflammatory, and normal cells.},

abstract = {The peripheral hearing process taking place in the cochlea mainly depends on two distinct sensory cell types: the mechanosensitive hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The first respond to the mechanical stimulation exerted by sound pressure waves on their hair bundles by releasing neurotransmitters and thereby activating the latter. Loss of these sensorineural cells is associated with permanent hearing loss. Stem cell-based approaches aiming at cell replacement or in vitro drug testing to identify potential ototoxic, otoprotective, or regenerative compounds have lately gained attention as putative therapeutic strategies for hearing loss. Nevertheless, they rely on efficient and reliable protocols for the in vitro generation of cochlear sensory cells for their implementation. To this end, we have developed a differentiation protocol based on organoid culture systems, which mimics the most important steps of in vivo otic development, robustly guiding mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) toward otic sensory neurons (OSNs). The stepwise differentiation of mESCs toward ectoderm was initiated using a quick aggregation method in presence of Matrigel in serum-free conditions. Non-neural ectoderm was induced via activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and concomitant inhibition of transforming growth factor beta (TGF$\beta$) signaling to prevent mesendoderm induction. Preplacodal and otic placode ectoderm was further induced by inhibition of BMP signaling and addition of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Delamination and differentiation of SGNs was initiated by plating of the organoids on a 2D Matrigel-coated substrate. Supplementation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) was used for further maturation until 15 days of in vitro differentiation. A large population of neurons with a clear bipolar morphology and functional excitability was derived from these cultures. Immunostaining and gene expression analysis performed at different time points confirmed the transition trough the otic lineage and final expression of the key OSN markers. Moreover, the stem cell-derived OSNs exhibited functional electrophysiological properties of native SGNs. Our established in vitro model of OSNs development can be used for basic developmental studies, for drug screening or for the exploration of their regenerative potential.},

Many stem cell sources are desirable for differentiation into Schwann cells. Schwann-like cells derived from hEnSCs may be one of the ideal alternative cell sources for Schwann cell generation. In this study, for differentiation of hEnSCs into Schwann cells, hEnSCs were induced with RA/FSK/PDGF-AA/HRG as an induction medium for 14 days. The cells were cultured in a tissue culture plate (TCP) and fibrin gel matrix.

The attachment of cells was analyzed with SEM and DAPI staining. The expression of S100 and P75 as Schwann cell markers was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The evaluation of the MTT assay and gene expression showed that the survival rate and differentiation of hEnSCs into Schwann cells in the fibrin gel were better than those in the TCP group. These results suggest that human EnSCs can be differentiated into Schwann cells in the fibrin gel better than in the TCP, and the fibrin gel might provide a suitable three-dimensional (3D) scaffold for clinical applications for cell therapy of the nervous system.},

abstract = {Objective. Direct electrical stimulation of the brain through intracranial electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic brain as part of pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being considered for therapeutic treatments through neuromodulation. In order to effectively modulate neural activity, a given neuromodulation design must elicit similar responses throughout the course of treatment. However, it is unknown whether intracranial electrical stimulation responses are consistent across sessions. The objective of this study was to investigate the within-subject, cross-session consistency of the electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered through intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Approach. We analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with iEEG who underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory experiment. We quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a reference, we made the same measurements during baseline periods. Main results. In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band power could not be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of band power. Stimulation effect was consistent in a third of the session pairs, while the rest had a consistency measure not exceeding the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency was highly correlated with the degree of band power increase, and it also tended to be higher when the baseline conditions were more similar between sessions. Significance. These findings can inform our practices for designing neuromodulation with greater efficacy when using direct electrical brain stimulation as a therapeutic treatment.},

Axonal outgrowth could be precisely quantified and was shown to respond to the chemotherapeutic drug vincristine in a highly reproducible dose-dependent manner. The model was shown susceptible to excitotoxicity upon exposure with excess glutamate and showed formation of stress granules upon excess glutamate or sodium arsenite exposure, mimicking processes common in motor neuron diseases. Importantly, outgrowing axons could be attracted and repelled through a gradient of axonal guidance cues, such as semaphorins. The platform comprises 40 chips arranged underneath a microtiter plate providing both throughput and compatibility to standard laboratory equipment. The model will thus prove ideal for studying axonal biology and disease, drug discovery and regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {Regeneration of neural tissues will require regrowth of axons lost due to trauma or degeneration to reestablish neuronal connectivity. One approach toward this goal is to provide directional cues to neurons that can promote and guide neurite growth. Our laboratory previously reported the formation of aligned monodomain gels of peptide amphiphile (PA) nanofibers over macroscopic length scales. In this work, we modified these aligned scaffolds specifically to support neural cell growth and function. This was achieved by displaying extracellular matrix (ECM) derived bioactive peptide epitopes on the surface of aligned nanofibers of the monodomain gel. Presentation of IKVAV or RGDS epitopes enhanced the growth of neurites from neurons encapsulated in the scaffold, while the alignment guided these neurites along the direction of the nanofibers. After two weeks of culture in the scaffold, neurons displayed spontaneous electrical activity and established synaptic connections. Scaffolds encapsulating neural progenitor cells were formed in situ within the spinal cord and resulted in the growth of oriented processes invivo. Moreover, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells demonstrated extensive migration inside the scaffold, with the direction of their movement guided by fiber orientation. The bioactive and macroscopically aligned scaffold investigated here and similar variants can potentially be tailored for use in neural tissue regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective. The construction of in vitro three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue has to overcome two main types of challenges: (1) How to obtain enough number of functional neurons from stem cells in 3D culture; (2) How to wire those lately developed neurons into functional neural networks. Here, we describe the potential of using direct current (DC) electric field (EF) together with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) synergistically in promoting neural stem cell (NSC) neuronal differentiation following by directing neurite outgrowth in the 3D neural tissue construction. Approach. By adjusting the electrical stimulation setup in this study, long-term electrical stimulation could be present in vitro. At an EF strength of 150 mV mm-1, cell responses, including cell viability, neuronal differentiation, cell morphology, the length of neuronal processes, synaptic structure and neural network formation, were quantified and analyzed. Main results. Analysis revealed that NSCs showed no significant cell death after certain EF treatments. EF-stimulated NSCs in 3D Matrigel mainly differentiated into neurons, but unlike NSCs in two-dimensional conditions, their processes were flat and stunted. When combined with bFGF, EF stimulation provided appropriate bioactive cues to establish engineered neural tissue with a proper neuronal cell number, highly branched neurites, and a well-developed neuronal network. Significance. It is for the first time the synergistic effects of EF and bFGF stimulation have been evaluated in inducing the differentiation of NSCs into neurons and the acquisition of long neurites in a culture environment of in vitro 3D model. These optimized conditions may allow a well-developed neuronal network to be established within hydrogel droplets.},

abstract = {Stem cell-replacement therapies have been proposed as a potential tool to treat sensorineural hearing loss by aiding the regeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the inner ear. However, transplantation procedures have yet to be explored thoroughly to ensure proper cell differentiation and optimal transplant procedures. We hypothesized that the aggregation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived otic neuronal progenitor (ONP) cells into a multicellular form would improve their function and their survival in vivo post-Transplantation. We generated hESC-derived ONP spheroids-an aggregate form conducive to differentiation, transplantation, and prolonged cell survival-to optimize conditions for their transplantation. Our findings indicate that these cell spheroids maintain the molecular and functional characteristics similar to those of ONP cells, which are upstream in the SGN lineage. Moreover, our phenotypical, electrophysiological, and mechanical data suggest an optimal spheroid transplantation point after 7 days of in vitro three-dimensional (3D) culture. We have also developed a feasible transplantation protocol for these spheroids using a micropipette aided by a digital microinjection system. In summary, the present work demonstrates that the transplantation of ONP cells in spheroid form into the inner ear through micropipette 7 days after seeding for 3D spheroid culture is an expedient and viable method for stem cell replacement therapies in the inner ear.},

abstract = {Certain insect viruses produce stable infectious micro-crystals called polyhedra which function to protect the virus after the death of infected larvae. Polyhedra form within infected cells and contain numerous virus particles embedded in a crystalline lattice of the viral protein polyhedrin. We have previously demonstrated that the N-terminal 75 amino acids of the Bombx mori cypovirus (BmCPV) turret protein (VP3) can function as a polyhedrin recognition signal leading to the incorporation of foreign proteins into polyhedra. Foreign proteins tagged with the VP3 polyhedrin recognition signal were incorporated into polyhedra by co-expression with polyhedrin in insect cells. We have used this method to encapsulate a wide variety of foreign proteins into polyhedra. The atomic structure of BmCPV polyhedrin showed that the N-terminal H1 ??-helix of polyhedrin plays a significant role in cross-linking and stabilizing polyhedra. Here we show that the polyhedrin H1-helix can also function as a polyhedrin recognition signal and can be used like the VP3 N-terminal sequence to target foreign proteins into polyhedra. In addition, the two targeting methods can be used together to produce polyhedra containing both EGFP and Discosoma sp. Red Fluorescent Protein (DsRed). The modified polyhedra were imaged using dual-wavelength confocal microscopy showing that the two foreign proteins are uniformly incorporated into polyhedra at similar levels. We have investigated the biological and physiological properties of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), FGF-7 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) immobilized on polyhedra with either the H1 or the VP3 tag. Growth factors produced by both methods were functional, inducing the growth of fibroblast cells and keratinocytes. The results demonstrate the utility and flexibility of modified polyhedra for encapsulating and stabilizing bioactive proteins. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper compares the ability of some simple model functions to describe orientation tuning curves obtained in extracellular single-unit recordings from area 17 of the cat visual cortex. It also investigates the relationships between three methods currently used to estimate preferred orientation from tuning curve data: (a) least-squares curve fitting, (b) the vector sum method and (c) the Fourier transform method (W{\"{o}}rg{\"{o}}tter and Eysel 1987). The results show that the best fitting model function for single-unit orientation tuning curves is a von Mises circular function with a variable degree of skewness. However, other functions, such as a wrapped Gaussian, fit the data nearly as well. A cosine function provides a poor description of tuning curves in almost all instances. It is demonstrated that the vector sum and Fourier methods of determining preferred orientation are equivalent, and identical to calculating a least-square fit of a cosine function to the data. Least-squares fitting of a better model function, such as a von Mises function or a wrapped Gaussian, is therefore likely to be a better method for estimating preferred orientation. Monte-Carlo simulations confirmed this, although for broad orientation tuning curves sampled at 45° intervals, as is typical in optical recording experiments, all the methods gave similarly accurate estimates of preferred orientation. The sampling interval, the estimated error in the response measurements and the probable shape of the underlying response function all need to be taken into account in deciding on the best method of estimating preferred orientation from physiological measurements of orientation tuning data.},

The 3,259-nucleotide sequence contains a single long open reading frame which spans nucleotides 14 to 3187 and which is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of about 130 kDa. Western blot analysis showed that S4 encodes BmCPV protein VP3, which is one of the outer components of the BmCPV virion. Sequence analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of BmCPV VP3 revealed possible sequence homology with proteins from rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) S2, Nilaparvata lugens reovirus S4, and Fiji disease fijivirus S4. This may suggest that plant reoviruses originated from insect viruses and that RRSV emerged more recently than other plant reoviruses. A chimeric protein consisting of BmCPV VP3 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed and expressed with BmCPV polyhedrin using a baculovirus expression vector. The VP3-GFP chimera was incorporated into BmCPV polyhedra and released under alkaline conditions. The results indicate that specific interactions occur between BmCPV polyhedrin and VP3 which might facilitate BmCPV virion occlusion into the polyhedra.},

Using a multikinase inhibitor, we transdifferentiated fibroblasts into transient neural precursors that were subsequently further differentiated into Schwann cells. The resulting induced Schwann cells (iSCs) expressed numerous Schwann cell-specific proteins and displayed neurosupportive and myelination capacity in vitro.

In many brain circuits, synaptically released BDNF is essential for structural and functional long-term potentiation, two prototypical cellular models of learning and memory formation. Recent studies have revealed an unexpected complexity in the synaptic communication of mature BDNF and its precursor proBDNF, not only between local pre- and postsynaptic neuronal targets but also with participation of glial cells. Here, we consider recent findings on local actions of the BDNF family of ligands at the synapse and discuss converging lines of evidence which emerge from per se conflicting results.},

Therefore, MIPs used as recognition units in chemical sensors are gaining increasing interest.

In this study, we used self-assembling peptide amphiphile (PA) molecules that display an IKVAV epitope (IKVAV-PA) to create a niche for hESC-derived ONPs that supported neuronal differentiation and survival both in vitro and in vivo after transplantation into rodent inner ears. A feature of the IKVAV-PA gel is its ability to form organized nanofibers that promote directed neurite growth. Culture of hESC-derived ONPs in IKVAV-PA gels did not alter cell proliferation or viability. However, the presence of IKVAV-PA gels increased the number of cells expressing the neuronal marker beta-III tubulin and improved neurite extension. The self-assembly properties of the IKVAV-PA gel allowed it to be injected as a liquid into the inner ear to create a biophysical niche for transplanted cells after gelation in vivo. Injection of ONPs combined with IKVAV-PA into the modiolus of X-SCID rats increased survival and localization of the cells around the injection site compared to controls. Human cadaveric temporal bone studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of a transmastoid surgical approach for clinical intracochlear injection of the IKVAV-PA/ONP combination. Combining stem cell transplantation with injection of self-assembling PA gels to create a supportive niche may improve clinical approaches to spiral ganglion regeneration.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration is often characterized by the spontaneous onset of multicellular protrusions (known as fingers) led by a single leader cell. Working with epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers we show that cells within the fingers, as compared with the epithelium, are well oriented and polarized along the main finger direction, which suggests that these cells actively migrate. The cell orientation and polarity decrease continuously from the tip toward the epithelium over a penetration distance of typically two finger lengths. Furthermore, laser photoablation experiments at various locations along these fingers demonstrate that the cells in the fingers are submitted to a tensile stress whose value is larger close to the tip. From a dynamical point of view, cells entering a finger gradually polarize on timescales that depend upon their particular initial position. Selective laser nanosurgery of the leader lamellipodium shows not only that these structures need a leader to progress, but that this leader itself is the consequence of a prior self-organization of the cells forming the finger. These results highlight the complex interplay between the collective orientation within the fingers and the mechanical action of the leader. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Objective. The main objective of this research was to study the coupling between neural circuits and the vascular network in the cortex of small rodents from system engineering point of view and generate a mathematical model for the dynamics of neurovascular coupling. The model was adopted to implement closed-loop blood flow control algorithms. Approach. We used a combination of advanced technologies including optogenetics, electrocorticography, and optical coherence tomography to stimulate selected populations of neurons and simultaneously record induced electrocorticography and hemodynamic signals. We adopted system identification methods to analyze the acquired data and investigate the relation between optogenetic neural activation and consequential electrophysiology and blood flow responses. Main results. We showed that the developed model, once trained by the acquired data, could successfully regenerate subtle spatio-temporal features of evoked electrocorticography and cerebral blood flow responses following an onset of optogenetic stimulation. Significance. The long term goal of this research is to open a new line for computational analysis of neurovascular coupling particularly in pathologies where the normal process of blood flow regulation in the central nervous system is disrupted including Alzheimer's disease.},
