\begin{abstract}
Although cochlear implant (CI) technology has allowed partial restoration of hearing over the last few decades, persistent challenges remain - including the deciphering of rich acoustic signals into a digital pulse-train signal. Among these challenges, the “electrode-neuron gap” poses the most significant obstacle to advancing past the current plateau in CI performance. Resulting issues include limited performance in noisy environments and a poor ability to decode intonation and music. We propose the development of a “neuroregenerative nexus”\textemdash a biological interface that doubly preserves endogenous spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) while precisely directing the growth of neurites arising from transplanted human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived otic neuronal progenitors (ONPS), toward endogenous SGNs. We hypothesized that the Polyhedrin Delivery System (PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-human brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) could stably provide an adequate BDNF gradient to hPSC-derived ONPs, thereby simultaneously facilitating otic neuronal differentiation and directional neurite outgrowth. To test this hypothesis, we first devised a finite element model to simulate the \textit{in vitro} BDNF gradient generated by PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. For biological verification, we validated the concept of a neuroregenerative nexus by using a multi-chamber microfluidic device, which mimics the \textit{in vivo} micro-environment more accurately than conventional laboratory plates in terms of volume and concentrations of endogenous/exogenous factors. We were able to generate the optimal BDNF concentration gradient to enable survival, neuronal differentiation toward hPSC-derived SGNs, and directed neurite extension of hPSC-derived SGNs. The technique will allow us to further advance our concept of a “neuroregenerative nexus”  by controlling neurite direction of transplanted hPSC-derived ONPs. This proof-of-concept study provides a step toward the next generation of CI technology.

\section{Introduction}
\indent The cochlear implant (CI), which provides functional restoration in patients with sensorineural hearing loss, forms a neuro-electronic interface with the peripheral auditory nervous system \cite{Naples2020a}. CI technology functions by electrically stimulating the extant population of auditory neurons (i.e., spiral ganglion neurons [SGNs]). Although CI technology has allowed partial restoration of hearing for this patient population over the last few decades, persistent challenges, including the deciphering of rich acoustic signals into digital pulse-train signals, remain. Among these challenges, the “electrode-neuron gap” poses the most significant obstacle to advancing past the current plateau in CI performance. This phenomenon symptomatically manifests as limited performance in noisy environments and poor ability to decode intonation and music \cite{Wilson2008a}, arguably decreasing quality of life. The gap exists between the CI electrode and the target membranes of dendrites in surviving endogenous SGNs \cite{Frick2017}. It results in the requirement of larger CI excitation fields, leading to current spread that excites and therefore disables the neighboring electrodes, resulting in fewer information channels to the brain, all within discrete time steps \cite{Wilson2008a, Hahnewald2016}. This can develop into a vicious cycle as fewer information channels to the brain also prompt the need for larger CI excitation fields. The length of the gap generally spans hundreds of $\mu$m \cite{Shepherd1993, Tykocinski2000}. Hahnewald et al. demonstrated \textit{in vitro} that energy needed to elicit a response can be reduced by up to 20\% by reducing the distance from 40 to zero $\mu$m (by growing early postnatal mouse SGN explants on a microelectrode array) \cite{Hahnewald2016}.

\indent Previous work has introduced the concept of a "bioactive" CI to resolve the electrode-neuron gap \textit{in vivo}\cite{Roemer2016a, Heuer2021, Chang2020}. The bioactive CI combines the current state-of-the-art CI technology with emerging stem cell–replacement therapy in the inner ear. In this scheme, transplanted human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived SGNs bridge the gap between the CI electrode and surviving endogenous SGNs. Furthermore, introducing neurotrophin gradients has been shown to guide hPSC grafts in spinal cord injury \cite{Taylor2006}, direct growth of endogenous SGNs toward CI electrodes in the scala tympani \cite{Senn2017}, and enable transplanted hPSC derived otic neuronal progenitors (ONPs) to grow neurites toward the modiolus \cite{Chang2020}. Although promising, these studies failed to observe adequate directed neurite outgrowth toward endogenous SGNs (i.e., lack of synaptic connections between hPSC grafts and endogenous SGNs), presumably preventing significant improvements in functional recovery of hearing.

PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} crystals are cubic protein co-crystals produced by Sf9 cells (a clonal isolate of \textit{Spodoptera frugiperda} Sf21 cells [IPLB-Sf21-AE], in which the polyhedrin protein and a second protein are co-expressed). This second protein is termed as the active, or cargo protein (Figure 1B, left). Inside the Sf9 cells, polyhedrin proteins self-assemble in to cubic crystals (Figure 1B, center) while the active protein, tagged with a short peptide sequence, bind to the growing polyhedrin crystal. The crystals are extracted and purified by simple cell lysis and washes to removed cell debris (Scanning electron micrograph, Figure 1B, right).

\end{figure}

\indent To confront this issue, we propose the development of a “neuroregenerative nexus”\textemdash a biological interface that doubly preserves endogenous SGNs and precisely directs the growth of neurites arising from transplanted hPSC-derived ONPs toward the endogenous SGNs. The highlighted yellow-square area in Figure 1A shows a schematic diagram of this concept. Here, the neuroregenerative nexus (shown as an orange rectangle in Figure 1A) stimulates neurite outgrowth from both the hPSC-derived ONPs and the endogenous SGNs via a neurotrophic factor gradient \cite{Goodhill1998}. While the concept of using a neurotrophin gradient for directional axonal growth has existed for a few decades, incorporation of neurotrophin gradients with any tissue- or bio-engineered scaffold has been extremely challenging due to the lack of self-sustaining neurotrophin delivery methods—their eventual depletion triggers an accelerated decline in neurite growth and survival of extant SGNs \cite{Gillespie2003, Pettingill2008, Shepherd2009}. One major contributor is the structurally unstable nature of neurotrophins, which suffer from fragility and thermo-instability under normal physiological conditions both \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}, leading to short half-lives typically ranging from minutes to hours \cite{Baseri2012}. We set out to mitigate this phenomenon by utilizing the polyhedrin delivery system (PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered})\textemdash a crystalline growth factor formulation developed to enable long-term release of growth factors (e.g., neurotrophins) \cite{Ikeda2001a,Suzuki1997,Mori1993} (Figure 1B). The PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} technology has adapted viral machinery to encase a chosen growth factor into polyhedrin protein cases.The resultant growth factor co-crystals have slow degradation profiles under physiological conditions and, therefore, allow the sustained release of embedded bioactive growth factors.  

\indent We reasoned that a bio-engineered scaffolding incorporated with PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} technology can establish a neuronal network between transplanted hPSC-derived ONP grafts and extant SGNs in the inner ear. More specifically, we hypothesized that PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-recombinant human neurotrophin system could stably provide and maintain an adequate neurotrophin gradient to facilitate otic neuronal differentiation of and directional neurite outgrowth from hPSC-derived ONPs, . To test this hypothesis, we first devised a finite element model (FEM) to simulate the \textit{in vitro} neurotrophin gradient generated by PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. In this study, we focus on the role of BDNF\textemdash the most studied of the neurotrophins in the inner ear, and the most vital for the functional recovery of damaged SGNs \cite{green2012}. For biological validation and demonstration we used a multi-chamber microfluidic device, that which mimics the \textit{in vivo} micro-environment of the inner ear more so than conventional laboratory plates in terms of volume and concentrations of endogenous/exogenous factors \cite{Meyvantsson2008}.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Polyhedrin delivery system}
The Polyhedrin Delivery System (PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-human BDNF [rhBDNF]) (Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used as a self sustaining source of rhBDNF. PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF is composed of the polyhedrin protein formed by \textit{Bombyx mori}, an insect from the moth family \textit{Bombycidae}. A cargo protein (i.e., rhBDNF) is co-expressed within the polyhedrin crystal and is slowly released by breakdown of the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} crystals via cell-secreted proteases (Figure 1B)\cite{Chang2020, Suzuki1997, Guo2017}. 

\subsection{Human pluripotent stem cell culture using dual-compartment microfluidic device}
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs: H7 and H9, passage number 25\textendash 35) were obtained from WiCell Research Institute (Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs:  TC-1133HKK, passage number 22\textendash 35) were generated from human CD34+ cord blood cells using the four Yamanaka factors at Lonza (Walkersville, Maryland [MD], USA). The hiPSC cell line (TC-1133HKK) was kindly provided by Healios K.K. (Tokyo, Japan). hPSC-derived ONPs were derived based on our previously established protocol (Supplemental Data) \cite{Heuer2021,Chang2020, Matsuoka2017g, Matsuoka2017}. A step-wise series of ligands and growth factors was added to a neuronal induction medium to promote hPSC differentiation toward the late-stage ONP lineage\textemdash the mitotic progenitor population that generates SGNs. (Figure 2).

Microfluidic devices provide a platform for specifically evaluating axonal regeneration \cite{Al-Ali2017a}. Here, multi-chamber microfluidic devices, Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} Microfluidics XC150 and XC450 (Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} Microfluidics, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA), were used for computational calculation and biological validation (Figure 3A\textendash B) of an FEA. The Xona \textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device allows for neurites to grow toward growth factors in the opposite chamber while limiting migration of derived ONP cell bodies due to specific dimensions of the device. \added{Additionally, the microchannel array between the two chambers mimics the porous bony separation (osseous spiral lamina) between the modiolus (where extant SGNs are localized) and the scala tympani (where the biohybrid CI will be implanted). Thus the diffusion profile of the released rhBDNF \textit{in vitro} more accurately predicts that of the \textit{in vivo}.}

Two main channels (somal compartment (SC) and neurotrophin compartment (NTC)) on either side are connected by a micro-groove channel (MGC) spanning 450 $\mu$m with a width of 10 $\mu$m (black square).

\end{figure}

The devices were washed and coated with poly-L-ornithine (PLO, 20 $\mu$g/mL in H\lowercase{2}O, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri [MO], USA) and recombinant laminin-511 (iMatrix-511, 0.5 mg/mL, Nacalai USA, San Diego, California [CA], USA) according to the manufacturer-outlined protocol. Next, approximately 1.75  x 10$^{5}$ cells (in 20 $\mu$L of media) were added through the top and bottom left wells into the somal compartment (i.e., total amount of 3.5 x 10$^{5}$ hPSC-derived ONPs were added). 

\indent PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF were placed in the top right well of the neurotrophin compartment (Figure 3A\textendash B) to generate a rhBDNF concentration gradient to promote directional neurite growth.  hPSC-derived ONPs were cultured for 7 days in the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device to induce otic neuronal differentiation. Note that high-density cell cultures were induced to facilitate molecular studies as well as the generation of a more biologically relevant neuronal phenotype (i.e., otic lineage) \cite{Al-Ali2017a}. Media was topped off daily after imaging (from 20-40 $\mu$L per well).

\subsection{Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for brain-derived neurotrophic factor}
In order to determine the breakdown and release kinetics of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF, an experiment measuring rhBDNF concentrations at sequential time points was performed. The culture media from both a control and experimental condition were collected at each time point and immediately stored at -80$^\circ$C before running an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after the final collection. The same method was applied to measure the degradation kinetics of rhBDNF protein with a carrier protein (Bovine Serum Albumin [BSA]) (\#248-BDB-050, R\&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). Experimental conditions were culture media enriched with 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All rhBDNF samples were quantified with a BDNF ELISA kit (\# BGK23560; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, New Jersey, USA), and the results were analyzed with a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek, Winocski, Vermont, USA) at a 450 nm wavelength, as instructed by the manufacturer. Molecular kinetics were then calculated using the MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, CA, USA).

\subsection{Sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis} 
Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is commonly used as a method to separate proteins with molecular masses between 5 and 250 kDa  \cite{Laemmli1970}, a range of which is suitable for detecting recombinant human BDNF (molecular weight [MW]: 14kDa \cite {Mandel2009}) and polyhedrin (MW: $\sim$29 kDa \cite{Guo2017}). In this study, SDS-PAGE was used to assess the molar ratio of polyhedrin to BDNF at different quantities.  Briefly, each protein sample was diluted in deionized water and mixed with 6x Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Des Plaines, Illinois [IL], USA) containing 2-mercaptoethanol and heated at 100$^\circ$C for 5 to 20 minutes. Samples were then loaded into precast Mini-PROTEAN TGX 4-15\% polyacrylamide mini-gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). Then, 5 mL of Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA) were loaded in each gel run. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes using a constant voltage (100V) in 1x solution of Tris-Glycine-SDS electrophoresis buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA) until the dye front reached the end of the 60 mm gel. After electrophoresis, the mini-gels were rinsed with deionized water 3 times for 5 minutes and were subsequently incubated in SimplyBlue\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} SafeStain (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for one hour at room temperature with gentle agitation. Images obtained from gels were analyzed using ImageJ 1.53g (December 4, 2020, the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA \cite{Schneider2012}). The calculated molar ratio was applied to the COMSOL\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Multiphysics model to accurately predict the amount of rhBDNF released from PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the manufacture's technical guide (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). 

\subsection{Western Blot} 
The identity of the rhBDNF protein detected by SDS-PAGE was verified by Western blot (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Des Plaines, IL, USA). Briefly, the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was prepared in methanol for 30 seconds before soaking in 1x Tris-Glycine-Methanol transfer buffer for 10 minutes. Wet transfer was performed at 4$^\circ$C for approximately 60 minutes using a constant voltage (100V) in 1X solution of Tris-Glycine-Methanol transfer buffer. After transfer, the membrane was briefly rinsed with 1X Tris-buffered saline Tween-20 (TBST) and was subsequently blocked in 5\% BSA in TBST for 24 hours at 4$^\circ$C with gentle agitation. The membrane was then rinsed with 1x TBST before incubating in BDNF polyclonal antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted to 1:1500 in 1\% BSA in TBST for 24 hours at 4$^\circ$C with gentle agitation. Following incubation, the membrane was rinsed in 1x TBST 5 times for 5 minutes to remove unbound primary antibody. Then, the membrane was incubated in Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted to 1:5000 in 1\% BSA in TBST for one hour at room temperature with gentle agitation. Following incubation, the membrane was rinsed in 1x TBST 5 times for 5 minutes to remove unbound secondary antibody. For sensitive detection, the membrane was treated with Pierce\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and visualized using an Azure 600 Digital Imager (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA, USA). Electrophoresis buffer for sample condition and run condition was summarized in Supplementary Table S1. 

\subsection{Three-dimensional finite element analysis}
We used finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate the BDNF concentration gradient over time in a multi-chamber microfluidic device. FEA is a computational numerical technique, which approximates mathematical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) that appropriately simulate complex real-world problems including stress/strain testing, thermal conduction, and diffusion in various geometries and materials. In this study, the FEM allowed us to predict the concentration gradient with respect to time depending on the number of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF introduced into the system. To solve the FEM, we used COMSOL\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Multiphysics (version 5.6 [released on November 11, 2020], COMSOL, Inc., Burlington, Massachusetts [MA], USA), which is a finite element method solution tool for engineering and scientific research computations. We used sustained-release kinetics for PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF determined from aforementioned ELISA studies, SDS-PAGE, as well as data from a previous study from our group \cite{Chang2020}. Device geometry was generated at a 1:1 scale using Autodesk\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Inventor 2019.0.2 (Autodesk, Mill Valley, CA, USA) (Figure 3B). The computational analysis was implemented on a high-performance desktop computer platform equipped with a 64 GB RAM CPU (AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X 64-Core, 128-Thread @ 4.3 GHz) and two GPU cards (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti,12GB 384-bit GFF6X Graphics card).

\subsection{Immunocytochemistry and image acquisition}
Microfluidic devices were coated with poly-d-lysine (PDL) (\#A3890401, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and poly-ornithine (PLO) (\# A-004-C, MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as per the manufucturer’s instructions. A total of 100,000 dissociated hPSC-derived ONPs were plated into the somal compartment of the device. On Day 7, 4\% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to the compartments for 20 minutes to fix the cells. ICC was used to stain for GATA3, PAX8, and beta-III tubulin. These three proteins have shown to appropriately characterize ONPs in our previous studies \cite{Heuer2021, Chang2020, Matsuoka2017}. Following PBS wash, cultures were blocked with 5\% BSA at room temperature for 1 hour. Cultures were then incubated overnight at 4$^\circ$C on a shaker plate in primary antibody solution using Rabbit anti-Beta-III-Tubulin (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), Goat anti-PAX8 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and Mouse anti-GATA3 (1:500, R\&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Following PBS washes, cultures were incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes on a shaker plate in secondary antibody solution composed of Alexafluor647 anti-Rabbit (1:1000, ThermoFisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO, USA), Alexafluor488 anti-Goat (1:1000, ThermoFisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO, USA), and Alexafluor594 anti-Mouse (1:1000, ThermoFisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 1\% BSA. Following PBS -/- washes, cultures were incubated with DAPI for 20 minutes (300 nM, ThermoFisher Scientific, St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibody controls were performed each time multiple primary antibodies were used \cite{Burry2011}. Labeling controls (detection controls) were performed for a sample from each batch of hPSC culture \cite{Burry2011}. See Supplementary Figure S1 for exemplary figures for these control conditions. Results were imaged using a Nikon Ti2 Widefield Laser Microscope System (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Phase-contrast images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). All fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), a Nikon Ti2 laser laser-scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), or a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Welzlar, Germany). Observers were blinded to the conditions during imaging and tracing. In general, the images were processed with a Image J  ver. 1.53j or Matlab R2020b. Further detail on image acquisition and quantification of fluorescent-positive cells can be found in the Supplemental Data. 

\subsection {Preferred cell orientation analysis}
Collective cell migration, where cells organized in a tightly connected fashion migrate as cohesive structures, is a critical biological process to highlight the neurotrophin diffusion profile \cite{Mazalan2020}. To evaluate this process, time-lapse acquisition of images of the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device was performed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100, Tokyo, Japan) at Day 1, 3, 5, and 7. Due to the high cell density required for hPSC-derived late stage ONPs to survive in the somal compartment of the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device, images were not amenable to manual analysis in most of the cases. To circumvent this problem, we performed a series of image pre-processings that are mainly based on modified binarization-based extraction of aliment score methods with some modifications \cite{Xu2011}. We used MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox R2020b (version 9.9.0.1495850, September 30th, 2020, Mathorks, Natick, MA) for analysis. Please see Supplementary Figure S2 for further detail. The analysis of directional data in general represents a particular challenge: there is no reason to designate any particular point on the circle as zero, and it is somewhat arbitrary depending on where one sets a coordinate \cite{Batschelet1981,Berens2009}. In this study, we used polar coordinates to determine the directionality of preferred cell orientation.  For this analysis, we again used MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox R2020b. See detailed discussion on how we determined the preferred cell orientation in Supplementary Figure S3.

\subsection{Neurite alignment vector assay, neurite growth assay and cell migration assay}
The microfluidic device allowed us to culture hPSC-derived ONPs in a polarized manner and to directly isolate/analyze neurites. To evaluate the neurite projection into the neurotrophin compartment by derived otic neurons cultured in the somal compartment, we performed a neurite alignment vector assay. We also evaluated the length of neurites that grew from hPSC-derived ONPs. For these purposes, hPSC-derived ONPs were cultured in a Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} XC450 for seven days and then immunostained with $beta$-III tubulin and DAPI. We used two ImageJ plug-in toolkits, NeuriteTracer and NeuronJ, to assess neurite alignment and neurite growth \cite{Pool2008, Meijering2004}. Due to the bipolar nature of hPSC-derived ONPs/SGNs, we measured the two longest neurites from the cells \cite{Matsuoka2017,Anniko1995}. Please see Supplementary Figure S4 for detailed description of this analysis. We used hPSC-derived ONPs cultured with 800,000 PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF as a positive control. The quantity 800,000 was selected based on our FEM in that no neurotrophin gradient was present in the somal compartment. As a negative control, we used 20 ng/mL of recombinant human BDNF. To evaluate cell migration across the microgroove channels, we performed cell migration analysis. We manually counted the number of ONPs that migrated from the somal compartment into the microchannels and neurotrophin compartment. 

\subsection{Statistical analysis}
When appropriate, and as indicated in each figure, statistical analysis was performed. Experimental values are typically expressed as mean and standard error (SE). The majority of the statistical analyses were performed with Python 3.9.6. (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, Delaware, USA). The following libraries were used for the statistical analysis: Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn \cite{5725236, hunter2007,Virtanen2020}. Normal distributions were assumed unless otherwise mentioned. $P$ values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For circular statistics, we derived the sample mean vector and its polar coordinate. Mean and confidence intervals were calculated. We chose confidence coefficient, $Q$, e.g. $Q = 0.95$. To analyze the axial nature of data, especially to compute the mean vector angle, we doubled each angle and reduced the multiples modulo 360\degree. Please see detailed discussion in Supplementary Figure S3 and S5. The Rayleigh test of uniformity and V-test were performed to determine whether the samples differ significantly from randomness (i.e., where there is statistical evidence of directionality). One-sample test for the mean angle was performed to test whether the population mean angle is statistically different from the given angle. In all of our circular statistics, von Mises distribution was assumed and also verified. Circular statistics were performed using CircStat: A MATLAB Toolbox \cite{Berens2009, Berens2009a}. Please see detailed description of circular statistics in Supplementary Figure S3 and S5. Experiments were done in three biological replicates unless otherwise specified in Figure captions.

\indent The appropriate number of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF crystals to induce an effective neurotrophin gradient for otic neuronal differentiation and directed neurite outgrowth was calculated using a three-dimensional FEA that predicts the concentration profile of BDNF formed through the gradual release and diffusion of BDNF from PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF. First, we quantified the chemical kinetics of this phenomenon with ELISA testing (Figure 4) to establish the parameters for the FEA. Here, two consecutive chemical reactions occur: 1) the breakdown of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} crystals into polyhedrin protein and rhBDNF, and 2) the degradation of rhBDNF toward the degradation product (Equation (1)).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Equation 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
	PODS\overset{k1}{\longrightarrow}BDNF + PHP\overset{k2}{\longrightarrow}DP + PHP
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $DP$ is the degradation product of the released rhBDNF, PHP is the polyhedrin protein, and $k\textsubscript{1}$ and $k\textsubscript{2}$ are the rate constants ($\frac{1}{hour}$) for their respective reactions.


Degradation kinetics data for rhBDNF was collected while monitoring rhBDNF concentration after introducing a predefined amount into a single well of solution. The data obtained throughout the first 72 hours indicate an exponential decay, suggesting first order kinetics (Figure 4). To confirm this notion, we performed a linear and nonlinear least square analysis of the kinetic data with the MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox. We found that the corresponding $R^{2}$ was 0.93169 for the first order curve-fit, confirming that the degradation kinetics was indeed first order. The rate constant for a first order reaction is defined to be slope of the time plot of the logarithmic ratio between concentration and initial concentration The value for $k\textsubscript{2}$ ( 0.0679 ($\frac{1}{hour}$) ) is the slope of the logarithm of the ratio between concentration and initial concentration (See further detail in Supplementary Figure S7). Furthermore, data for the complete chemical reaction were collected by similarly monitoring rhBDNF concentration over time after placing a predefined amount of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF into a single well of solution. The data collected appeared to fit the curve for Equation 2, which describes the concentration of the intermediate product of two consecutive first order reactions:  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Equation 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
C_{rhBDNF} =  C_{PODS} \cdot k_1 \cdot (\frac{e^{-k_1 \cdot t}}{ k_2-  k_1}  + \frac{e^{-k_2 \cdot t}}{ k_1 -  k_2} )
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $C_{rhBDNF}$ is the concentration of rhBDNF and $C_{PODS}$ is the concentration of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} \cite{levenspiel1999}.

 We successfully fit the data to this equation's respective curve and empirically approximated $k_{1}$ to be 0.00686 ($\frac{1}{hour}$) after plugging in our value for $k_{2}$ (See further detail in Supplementary Figure S7).

 SDS-PAGE was used to separate PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF crystals into its constituent proteins to determine the molar ratio of polyhedrin to rhBDNF. Visualization with Coomassie G-250 solution (Figure 6A) revealed three distinct protein bands at 18.8 (a), 28.0 (b), and 46.8 (c) kDa, which correspond with the molecular weights of H1-tagged BDNF monomer, polyhedrin, and H1-tagged BDNF monomer attached with polyhedrin, respectively. Western blot analysis was subsequently conducted to confirm the identity of the 18.8 kDa band as rhBDNF. Enhanced chemiluminescence (Figure 6B) revealed four protein bands at 14.0 (a), 18.8 (b), 37.6 (c), and 46.8 (d) kDa, which correspond with the molecular weights of rhBDNF monomer, H1-tagged BDNF monomer, H1-tagged BDNF dimer, and H1-tagged BDNF monomer attached with polyhedrin. Immunoblot detection of the 18.8 kDa band further implicates its identity as rhBDNF. SDS-PAGE images were converted to 8-bit grayscale and mean corrected integrated pixel intensity values were calculated for protein bands located at 28.0 and 18.8 kDa; the protein band detected at 46.8 kDa was omitted from the final computation based on the fact that it contained a 1:1 ratio of polyhedrin to BDNF. Results indicate that the molecular ratio of polyhedrin to rhBDNF is approximately 22:1. This transforms Equation (1) into:

 \begin{equation}

 Using these calculated rate constants with the calculated molar ratio, the resulting chemical gradient over time after PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF placement can be solved for any geometry by applying Fick’s second Law of diffusion (Equation 4) and the appropriate boundary (Equations 5 and 6) and initial conditions (Equation 7):

where $C$ is the concentration of rhBDNF, $D$ is diffusivity of rhBDNF (6.76 $\frac{mm\textsuperscript{2}}{day} $ \cite{Stroh2004}), $-k\textsubscript{2}\cdot C$ is the sink term corresponding to the degradation and cell-utilization of the rhBDNF, and $PODS_{0}$ is the initial concentration of the cargo protein (i.e., BDNF) within the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} crystals. The first boundary condition (Equation 4) shows that the concentrations of rhBDNF at the walls of the microfludic device are fixed at 0. The second boundary condition (Equation 5) represents the exponential nature of the decay of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. Note that both are Neumann boundary conditions. 

\indent We empirically tested two commercially available microchannel lengths\textemdash (i.e., Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}-XC150 [150 $\mu$m] and Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark}-XC450 [450 $\mu$m]). This was done first because mass (i.e., BDNF) transport from the neurotrophin compartment through the micro-groove channels into the somal compartment is an important factor in generating the concentration gradient \textit{via} diffusion mixing.  We determined that the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} Microfluidics XC450 was more appropriate for this study as the XC-150's micro-groove channels were not long enough to generate the appropriate concentration gradient throughout the somal compartment. This feature is relevant to human inner ear because the micro-groove channels in the Xona device simulates the presence of the osseous spiral lamina and modiolus between the scala tympani and SGNs  \cite{Tuncel2005,Kucuk1991a}. Following device selection, we generated a three-dimensional geometry mesh of the XC450 for the FEA (Figure 3B(d)). Please see Supplementary Figure S6 for detailed measurements of the mesh.

The finite element model was then computed for different PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF concentrations and time intervals to empirically optimize the rhBDNF concentration gradient for hPSC-derived ONP differentiation into SGNs as well as directed neurite extension. Figure 6 shows FEM-computed rhBDNF concentration gradients for 20,000 PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF from Day 1\textendash 7. Note that the rhBDNF concentrations were greater throughout D2\textendash 5 to promote the neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth observed on D7 (Figure 6B). Computed diffusion flux was uniform throughout D1\textendash 7 (Figure 6C). Also note that highest concentration of rhBDNF released from PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-crystals was greater than 50 pg/mL, the concentration sufficient for otic neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of hPSC-derived ONP 3D spheroids determined in our previously published data \cite{Chang2020}. Optimization of the adequate number of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF was performed empirically; we also performed FEA with 10,000 and 40,000 PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF. Please see detailed discussion for the empirical optimization in Supplementary Figure S8.

To objectively compare the degree of otic neuronal differentiation in the hPSC-derived ONPs, we performed quantitative analysis of PAX8 and GATA3 double-positive cells using immunocytochemistry. We chose PAX8 and GATA3 for this analysis because our previous studies indicated high expression of these protein markers in late-stage ONPs and early-stage SGNs \cite{Heuer2021,Chang2020, Matsuoka2017}. Cells were stained in the somal compartment of the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device, highlighted in green in Figure 7A. Figure 7B shows the resulting image of cells in the somal compartment, and a heat-map representation of the percentage of double-positive cells is shown in Figure 7C.
It should be noted that the heat-map is sensitive to the differences in cell density across channel. This was accounted for by averaging the double-positivity across three biological replicates. The heat-map indicates higher double-positivity in the upper region of the somal compartment, which is closest to the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF disc placement (shown as an orange ellipse in Figure 7A) in the neurotrophin compartment. Double-positivity decreases in the somal compartment as distance from the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF disc increases, supporting the presence of a rhBDNF neurotrophin gradient as predicted by our computational model (Figure 7D).

\indent We defined two hypothetical directional angles to predict the orientation of hPSC-derived ONPs and neurite growth (Figure 8). The $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, denoted by $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, is a linear vector space in that we can use polar coordinates to compute the directionality of cells and neurites \cite{Axler2015}. Here, we used $n$ = 1 and 2. For one-dimensional Euclidean space ($n$ = 1), we simply drew a line for the Euclidean distance\textemdash the shortest distance between two points as shown in Figure 8A(b) (dark green lines).  The two points were 1) the center point of the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF disc ($P$) and 2) the mid point of the medial side ($Q_{1-5}$) (i.e., the near side to microgroove channels) of a pre-designated square (shown as a black square, zones 1\textendash 5 in Figure 8), respectively. The Euclidean distance angle (EDA), $\phi_{i}$, was defined as the angle between the horizontal line zero direction and the line $PQ_{i}$ that consists of the Euclidean distance where $i$ = 1 \textendash 5.\\
\indent For two-dimensional Euclidean space ($n$ = 2), we utilized Fick's first law, which dictates that the diffusion flux ($D$) is proportional to the concentration gradient ($C$) \cite{crank1979}. Based on this theorem, the direction of a flow vector can be used to represent the concentration gradient for directionality. We hypothesized here that cell orientation is directionally controlled by the flux vector which is driven by the concentration gradient. Figure 8B shows the flow vectors in the somal compartment at Day 7 computed by the COMSOL Chemical Reaction Engineering module.  We averaged the 10 flow vectors in each of five zones in Figure 8 to compute the diffusion flux angle (DFA), $\psi_{i}$, where $i$ = 1\textendash 5 in Figure 8. To lighten the computational intensity, we reduced the dimension from 3D to 2D to compute diffusion flux. Please see justification in Supplementary Data. All of the computed EDAs and DFAs can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

\indent Figure 9 shows time-series of microscopic phase-contrast photomicrographs obtained on Day 1, 3, and 7 in the five zones in the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} XC450. Each preferred orientation of any given cell was computed and then plotted on a polar diagram (blue circle). Mean vector angle (MVA, shown in red line on Figure 9) and median vector angle were computed. All of the polar diagrams in Figure 9 show that preferred orientation of hPSC-derived ONPs distribute in an unimodal distribution. We also confirmed that a von Mises distribution is appropriate for these sets of data (See Supplementary Figure S9). We, therefore, then tested further to see if the cells had tendency to be oriented to a certain direction. To test this hypothesis, we used the Rayleigh test of uniformity to evaluate whether there is statistical evidence of circular directionality \cite{Batschelet1981}. Computed $p$ values for all the 15 conditions were less than 0.05, demonstrating that all of the conditions had statistically significant directionality. To further validate whether the observed angles have a tendency to cluster around the two hypothetical angles (i.e., EDA and DFA), we then performed the V test. Once again, $p$ values for all 15 conditions were less than 0.05 except one (Zone 5 on Day 1), re-demonstrating that most of the conditions had statistically significant tendencies to cluster around the EDAs and DFAs. Additionally, we performed one sample test for the mean vector angle, which is similar to a one sample t-test on a linear scale. There was only one condition (Zone 1, day 1) that was statistically significant for EDA, whereas most of the conditions on Day 3 and 7 were statistically significant for DFA. Therefore, our results here demostrated that hPSC-derived ONPs had greater tendency to cluster around DFA than EDA. All computed statistical values are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

To evaluate the direction of neurites of hPSC-derived ONPs, we first defined EDA in Region 1-3 ($\phi^{\prime}_{j}$, $j$ =1 \textendash 3) (Figure 10A) and DFA ($\psi^{\prime}_{j}$, $j$ =1\textendash 3); similarly defined $\phi_{i}$ and $\psi_{i}$ as in Figure 8. All of the EDAs and DFAs defined here can be found in Supplementary Table S3. Polar histograms of the neurite direction angle in Regions 1\textendash 3 indicated that the two longest neurites were bimodal in nature (Figure 10B).  In contrast, polar histograms of those cultured with rhBDNF (negative control) and 800,000 PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-BNDF (positive control) did not indicate bimodal distribution\textemdash the neurites did not show directionality (Figure 10C). The Rayleigh test of uniformity for both the positive and negative control were greater than 0.05, demonstrating that both of the conditions had no statistically significant directionality (Supplementary Table S3: highlighted in green). We also analyzed the direction of the neurites using circular statistics. To obtain more realistic mean vector angles, we doubled each angle and reduced the multiples modulo 360\degree. In circular statistics, the bimodal distributed data can be transformed into a unimodal data by doubling the angle \cite{Batschelet1981}. The mean vector angles in Figure 10D (right column) indicates the situation where the vectors were canceled out between the two groups of angles distributed in a bimodal fashion, resulting in inaccurate representation. A circular plot in Figure 10D (right column) showed doubled angles, representing actual representation of the neurite vector angles. In all of the three regions, the Rayleigh test and V test for EDA and DFA indicated directionality (Supplementary Table S3). One sample test for the mean vector angles in Region 1\textendash 3 indicated that they were not statistically different from DFA, but all of the three mean vector angles were statistically different from EDA.

We also stained the devices for $\beta$-III tubulin to track neurite growth and extension across the micro-groove channels as well as cell migration in three selected regions (Figure 10A). The location of the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF disc in relation to the regions of interest in Figure 11A is indicated by a yellow circle. Quantitative analyses were performed and summarized in Figure 11B. Our data indicate that neurite length is dependent on rhBDNF concentration, with greater amounts of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF promoting longer neurite growth (Figure 11B(a)). Lesser amounts of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF, however, are necessary to create an appropriate concentration gradient. In the presence of 20,000 PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF, both neurite extension into the microchannels and cell migration into the neurotrophin compartment are greatest in the region closest to the BDNF source and decrease further from the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF (Figure 11B(b,c)). Cell migration is dependent on the distance from the source of BDNF, thus suggesting the presence of a BDNF gradient as predicted by our model. Note that the Xona microchannels intended to prevent from migration across channels.

This is a proof-of-concept study for the realization of a neuroregenerative nexus to ascertain its scientific/technological parameters in a controlled \textit{in vitro} environment. Neurotrophin gradients have been studied in multiple contexts \cite{Keefe2017,Awad2015,Hollis2011}. However, it has not been feasible to reliably provide, and maintain, such a gradient to neurons \textit{in vivo}, primarily because of technical challenges including failure to provide a sustainable source and practical implantation. Furthermore, while neurotrophin treatment has been recognized as a potential treatment for sensorineural hearing loss, there has not been long-term clinical success in this avenue to date. Most recent relevant clinical trials used adeno-associated virus (AAV2) to deliver BDNF to the brain \cite{Nagahara2018}. Although compelling, this treatment does not attempt to precisely control the concentration of BDNF, which could potentially interfere with normal functions in the target organ \cite{Croll1999}. Furthermore, this treatment may not be applicable to the inner ear, as the procedure is MR-guided\textendash technically infeasible in the inner ear. In this study, we used PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF to generate and maintain a neurotrophic gradient in a controlled manner. Our results indicate that 20,000 PODS-rhBDNF allowed for a rhBDNF neurotrophin gradient such that hPSC-derived ONPs survived, differentiated toward human SGNs, and also established directional neurite outgrowth in a microfludic device. Furthermore, our proposed solution has greater potential to be translated into clinical practice; in addition to its proven natural self-sustainability, we have shown previously that transplantation of PODS-rhBDNF is met with little immune rejection when embedded in a nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel in mice \cite{Chang2020}.

\subsection{Microfluidic device-generated gradient}
We utilized a microfluidic device to advance our understanding of directional neurite growth and otic neuronal differentiation in response to a rhBDNF concentration gradient \cite{dravid2020}. Among many \textit{in vitro} concentration gradient sustaining culture devices, microfluidic devices have overcome many of the deficits that conventional platforms (i.e., the Boyden chamber, Dunn chambers, or compartmentalized diffusion chambers) face \cite{dravid2020}. Conventional platforms tend to be sub-optimal in manipulating small volumes of fluid at the order of microliters. Growth factors and proteins are used in minute amounts in our microfluidic device, and cultured stem cells are able to interact with endogenous factors at biologically relevant concentrations. As mentioned earlier, this micro-environment more accurately represents \textit{in vivo} conditions. The Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device can be used to create and sustain a three-dimensional concentration gradient over time (duration and diffusion profile dependent on the chemical kinetics of the molecule) because of its microchannel array.  The device limits convective flow in the gradient-forming areas by introducing microgroove channels that generate high fluidic resistance, thereby limiting flow to diffusion. The high resistance of the microchannel array also prolongs diffusion across them, thereby increasing gradient formation and decreasing gradient steepness (essentially elongating it). These features motivated us to generate a FEM, which predicted the rhBDNF gradients associated with different numbers of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-BDNF crystals. Note, however, that this environment is geometrically different from the micro-environment in the inner ear\textendash a mesh geometry of the cochlea will be needed to compute the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-BDNF crystal number for implementation in animals, as well as further clinical translation. 

\subsection {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor} 
Over the course of the past 20\textendash 30 years, it has been established that BDNF mediates survival and differentiation activities of SGNs by binding and activating tyrosine kinase receptor kinase B (TrkB), a member of the larger family of Trk receptors \cite{green2012}. Numerous studies have reported that BDNF can palliate SGN degeneration in ototoxically deafened animals, a widely accepted model for retrograde trans-synaptic SGN degeneration secondary to hair cell destruction \cite{Gillespie2003,Pettingill2008,Yamagata2004,Zanin2014}. Additionally, it has been confirmed that there is a positive correlation between SGN counts and CI performance \cite{Seyyedi2014}. It is then safe to presume that BDNF application in CI recipients would enhance overall CI performance, by preserving extant SGNs and their neurites.  Although promising, BDNF treatment in humans has not been implemented in the inner ear: simply introducing BDNF into the inner ear poses significant hurdles. 

\indent Unsuccessful BDNF treatment is attributed to several factors \cite{Henriques2010}. The blood half-life of BDNF protein is extremely short, lasting only 1–10 minutes in plasma \cite{Poduslo1996,Sakane1997} and one hour in CSF \cite{Soderquist2009}. Due to BDNF's high degradation rate, treatment would require continuous replenishment, impractical in the clinical setting. Furthermore, simply introducing BDNF in solution would presumably promote non-directional neurite growth where directed neurite growth is essential\textendash especially in the case of our proposed bioactive CI. Directing neurite growth towards the CI electrode array is pivotal in the ultimate goal of enhancing performance through the narrowing of the electrode-neuron gap. The PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} system can preclude this phenomena through its gradual release of growth factor from a localized origin. This steady supply of BDNF from a localized origin not only generates a concentration gradient, but maintains it over time. As shown in Figure 6, it is unmistakable that the slow-release nature of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-BDNF results in a concentration gradient over the course of Day 1\textendash 7. As shown in Figures 7\textendash 11, careful calibration of the resulting BDNF gradient can lead to the promotion of hPSC-derived ONP differentiation towards SGN lineage and directed neurite extension. 

\indent It should be noted that our FEM assumes free diffusion of the rhBDNF protein. In biological cell-culture conditions, rhBDNF released from PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF has tendency to adhere to walls of the culture device, due to its nature as a "sticky" protein of about 27 kDa (mature BDNF dimer) that is positively charged under physiological conditions (isoelectric point, pI = 9.4) \cite{Sasi2017}. As such, the physio-chemical properties of rhBDNF have rendered the protein prone to diminished diffusive transport. This phenomenon was observed in preliminary data where the ONPs failed to survive past 1\textendash 3 days of culture (data not shown). To circumvent this issue we infused the culture media with a carrier protein (i.e., BSA), hypothesizing that the albumin would act as a carrier for the released rhBDNF and allow for free diffusive transport throughout the microfluidic device \cite{Li2010}. This hypothesis is supported by our sets of biological validation data (Figures 7\textendash 11) clearly showing that hPSC-derived ONPs responded to positively to the modification; they exhibited the expected cell characteristics, body orientation, unidirectional neurite extension, and neurite length. Note that as albumin is the single most highly concentrated protein in the perilymph \cite{Swan2009}, therefore, an artificially introduced carrier protein would not be required in future \textit{in vivo} studies.  

\subsection{Intracellular signaling initiated by the Tyrosine kinase B receptor}
Another issue for consideration in the interpretation of our results is the intracellular cell-signaling mechanism elicited by rhBDNF. Human BDNF (mature dimeric form) binds with high affinity to the TrkB receptor. The binding of BDNF to a TrkB receptor has been proven to be integral to the pro-neuronal effects of BDNF \cite{green2012}. Upon binding, TrkB dimerizes and activates intrinsic kinase activities and other complex sets of intracellular signaling cascades, beyond the scope of this study. However, it should be noted that activation also initiates internalization by endocytosis in the cellular membrane and subsequently transported to the soma \cite{Numakawa2010}. Therefore, the pro-neuronal effects of rhBDNF in our results may be highly dependent on the status of the TrkB receptors of the cell membrane of hPSC-derived ONPs. Our previous study has demonstrated strong expression of TrkB receptors on derived ONPs \cite{Matsuoka2017}, however, more detailed studies on TrkB receptors of hPSC-derived ONPs and SGNs are needed to deepen understanding.

\subsection{Degradation of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} crystals by protease activity}
In cell culture, degradation of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF is likely due to the enzymatic activity of cell-secreted proteases. The proteases break down the peptide bonds of the encasing polyhedrin protein, creating openings in the structure to allow release of the rhBDNF. Therefore, the presence of proteases is imperative for the proper utilization of the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} technology. These proteases are additionally responsible for subsequent degradation of the released rhBDNF. Because cells were not present in the culture media used for the PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered} degradation kinetics experiments, we infused the media with 10\% FBS, which inherently contains proteases, to promote polyhedrin degradation for BDNF release, and subsequent BDNF degradation to acquire parameters that more accurately describe \textit{in vitro} events. Moreover, since the cells and PODS are initially segregated into separate compartments within the culture device, cell-secreted proteases are unlikely to reach and degrade the PODS in time to support ONP survival and differentiation, which was apparent in experiments conducted without the addition of FBS (data not shown). Infusion of FBS was therefore required in these experiments as well. For clinical translation, however, we presume that cell-secreted proteases will be readily present in the inner ear and therefore preclude the need for artificial supplementation.

\subsection{A concept design: Neuroregenerative nexus}
The plateau in CI performance in treatment of sensorineural hearing loss has driven researchers to develop innovative supplementary treatment strategies to push the field past this hurdle. Our approach strives to directly address the issue at its core: the electrode-neuron gap\textendash which can lead to serious implications including low spatial frequency resolution and high power consumption. The data presented here can be used as a launchpad for the neuroregenerative nexus (NRN). The proposed NRN is a biointerface concept that integrates a long-term release source of neurotrophins (i.e., BDNF) with a biocompatible matrix to facilitate and maintain a neurotrophic factor gradient. Embedding the source (e.g., PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF) in a biocompatible matrix ensures localization as well as a mechanism to fine-tune degradation and release kinetics. Implanted in conjunction with the CI, it acts as a supportive bridge between extant SGNs and transplanted late-ONPs, which are localized on the implant electrodes themselves (see Figure 1 for schematic). The NRN would promote survival of both cell populations, differentiation of the late hPSC-derived ONP transplants towards SGNs, directional neurite growth, and synaptogenesis between the two cell populations, effectively creating a neuronal network between the patient and the CI. As a result, each electrode would stimulate cell bodies at exceptionally high resolution, essential for greater tonal differentiability (required for effective social interaction and music appreciation) and furthermore, increased quality of life for millions. The successful outcomes presented in this article are pivotal for the realization of a neuroregenerative nexus effective in the \textit{in vivo} environment. 

\subsection{The limitations of this study and future direction}
There are a few limitations associated with this study.  First, the reduction of spacial dimension to 2D  for diffusion modeling certainly affected the flux vector, which determines the predicted concentration vector. Given that the thickness (i.e., Z-axis) of the microfluidic device was 100 $\mu$m, we estimated that the effect was minimal. In the future, we plan to use PSC-derived 3D spheroids in the somal compartment so that flux vector and concentration gradient vector can more accurately model cell behavior. In this way, we will be able to circumvent the need to reduce diffusion calculations to 2D for computation performance in the modeling. 

\indent We generated a FEM that modeled rhBDNF's biological transport phenomenon from a PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF disc to the somal compartment of the Xona\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} device. Note that in this model, we focused on the major dependent variable, the concentration and diffusion profile of rhBDNF, to model the biological phenomenon. Other physical variables that promote cell migration, otic neuronal differentiation, and neurite growth were not taken into consideration. These variables include electrotaxis (electrical potential), durotaxis (matrix stiffness [i.e., laminin 511 in our case]) \cite{Gentile2016}, mechanotaxis (cell strain), and lastly cell migration by random walk \cite{berg1983}. In future studies, we will take these variables into consideration to more accurately represent the migration and neurite growth of hPSC-derived ONPs. 

\indent Insufficient contrast between cells and background in phase contrast images led to inaccuracies in cell orientation computation for some images. To address this issue, poor quality images were disregarded in the quantitative analysis. We occasionally used manual measurement for accuracy. Our future study may entail automated time-series cell analysis, which would allow more accurate measurement. Another alternative to address this issue would be with cell membrane staining in the future. 

\indent While 20,000 of PODS\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-rhBDNF were necessary for otic neuronal differentiation and directional neurite outgrowth of hPSC-derived ONPs, this condition may not be sufficient. For instance, it is still not understood whether the effects of other neurotrophic factors such as Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor could have a positive effect on ONP growth \cite{green2012, li2017, Schulze2020}. We are planning to investigate the effects of these and other neurotrophic factors in the future. Other aspects that could have an impact on directional neurite growth include endogenous factors secreted from hPSC-derived ONPs. While our previous study demonstrated that hPSC-derived ONPs only secreted negligible amounts of BDNF, quantified by ELISA \cite{Chang2020}, we currently lack data on other neurotrophins and molecules that can affect directional neurite growth in the inner ear. We selected to study BDNF because it is the most intensively studied neurotrophic factor in the field of hearing research \cite{green2012}. Previous studies have indicated that neurotrophic support of SGNs is mainly composed of BDNF and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) \cite{green2012,Sasi2017}. Therefore, the potential confounding effect of other neurotrophic factors (i.e, NT-3) and molecules secreted from derived SGNs require further investigation.  

\indent Despite these limitations, the presented evidence is clear and well grounded \textendash a precisely controlled and maintained BDNF concentration gradient is necessary for directional neurite extension.

\section* {Conclusions}
We successfully enabled survival, neuronal differentiation toward SGNs, and directed neurite extension of hPSC-derived ONPs with a neurotrophin gradient. The technique allows control of neurite growth of transplanted hPSC-derived ONPs in the inner ear. This proof-of-concept study translates to a step toward next-generation bioacitve CI technology.
